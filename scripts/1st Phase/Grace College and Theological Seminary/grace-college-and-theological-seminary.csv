Old Testament Studies 
Since the Old Testament, like the New, is divinely inspired, it must be given serious attention as an 
indispensable source for doctrine, correction, and spiritual growth. Its narratives provide hundreds of 
examples of God’s dealings with humankind, and by this we gain important insights into the heart of 
God and His expectations for His people. Its poetry exhibits the joys and agonies of those who pursued 
godliness, and its prophecies reveal God’s concern for Israel in ancient times as well as the future. The 
Old Testament is critical to the work of the pastor or Christian leader in preaching, teaching, discipling, 
counseling, and dealing with the challenges of administration. 
The seminary, therefore, requires all M.Div. candidates to acquire the ability to translate the Hebrew 
text of the Old Testament, to gain some practical work in the field of scientific exegesis, and to study the 
methods and results of biblical archaeology, literary criticism, and ancient near eastern backgrounds. 
The ultimate goal of these disciplines is not for mere intellectual entertainment, but to enable the 
student to present the theological, historical, and practical truths of the Old Testament through 
expository preaching and teaching. "

DI 8300,Ethics and Morality Across Cultures ,Three,"All Christians hold values derived from their culture. Many, if not most of these values, shape the 
expression of Christianity in their culture. Much of this is good as it reflects how Christianity is relevant

that particular context in regard to expressions of God’s will such as “honor your father and your 
mother,” and “husbands love your wives,” or yet “steal no longer….”  These culturally defined behaviors 
seek to respect God’s will and honor His name, but they depend on cultural definitions and therefore 

change from culture to culture. Obedience to God’s will is, to some extent, relative to the context in 
which it is practiced. It is not a question of whether a man should love his wife or not, but rather a

Old Testament Studies 
Since the Old Testament, like the New, is divinely inspired, it must be given serious attention as an 
indispensable source for doctrine, correction, and spiritual growth. Its narratives provide hundreds of 
examples of God’s dealings with humankind, and by this we gain important insights into the heart of 
God and His expectations for His people. Its poetry exhibits the joys and agonies of those who pursued 
godliness, and its prophecies reveal God’s concern for Israel in ancient times as well as the future. The 
Old Testament is critical to the work of the pastor or Christian leader in preaching, teaching, discipling, 
counseling, and dealing with the challenges of administration. 
The seminary, therefore, requires all M.Div. candidates to acquire the ability to translate the Hebrew 
text of the Old Testament, to gain some practical work in the field of scientific exegesis, and to study the 
methods and results of biblical archaeology, literary criticism, and ancient near eastern backgrounds. 
The ultimate goal of these disciplines is not for mere intellectual entertainment, but to enable the 
student to present the theological, historical, and practical truths of the Old Testament through 
expository preaching and teaching. "

DI 8300,Ethics and Morality Across Cultures ,Three,"All Christians hold values derived from their culture. Many, if not most of these values, shape the 
expression of Christianity in their culture. Much of this is good as it reflects how Christianity is relevant 
in their context. In many cases, cultural norms define what obedience to God’s Word should look like in 
that particular context in regard to expressions of God’s will such as “honor your father and your 
mother,” and “husbands love your wives,” or yet “steal no longer….”  These culturally defined behaviors 
seek to respect God’s will and honor His name, but they depend on cultural definitions and therefore 

change from culture to culture. Obedience to God’s will is, to some extent, relative to the context in 
which it is practiced. It is not a question of whether a man should love his wife or not, but rather a 
question of how he should do that. Issues of ethics and morality often cause conflict between people of
