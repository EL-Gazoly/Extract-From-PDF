INTERNATIONAL SCHOLAR TRANSITION 
PROGRAM (ISTP)
 
The International Scholar Transition Program, a Student and 
Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) approved pathway program, provides 
international students holding a TOEFL score of 50-78 iBT with solid 
foundation in academic English and American academic culture through 
concurrent enrollment in general education and composition courses. The 
Transition Program facilitates advancement of academic English skills for 
study in students’ respective majors. All courses carry academic credit 
and fulfill degree requirements or elective credits towards graduation. 
Degree-seeking students with iBT scores between 50 and 78 are 
admitted to the ISTP and must complete the program before moving 
to full academic study. Exchange and other fully enrolled students are 
invited to take ISTP coursework for help in English but are not admitted to 
the program. 
 
ISTP students study full-time for two semesters during the academic 
year, August to May. ISTP is not available in the summer. For ISTP 
students, non-ISTP courses are chosen in consultation with advisors in 
the student’s major. 
 
Students who complete ISTP coursework earning 2.0 or better in 
all courses and demonstrating English proficiency with an Institutional 
TOEFL (ITP) score greater than 500 (no sub-scores below 50) are 
eligible for full-time degree study. The ISTP must be completed before 
registration in courses numbered 3000 or greater. Students receiving less 
than 2.0 in any ISTP course must repeat that course. The program must 
be completed within three semesters.
 
Earlier graduation from any English program requires meeting the 
ONU admission standards for English proficiency (79 on the iBT with 
matching sub-scores; 6.0 on the IELTS with no sub-score below 5.5).
 
Students meeting English proficiency levels while enrolled in ISTP

ROTC
(Reserve Officer Training Corps)
AIR FORCE ROTC
 
The Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) program, 
offered by the Department of Aerospace Studies on the Bowling Green 
State University campuses, provides college-level education to prepare 
interested men and women for commissioning as second lieutenants in 
the United States Air Force. The program emphasizes the development of 
each student’s sense of personal integrity, honor, individual responsibility 
and potential as a leader and manager.
 
The AFROTC program consists of a General Military Course (GMC) 
offered to freshmen and sophomores and a Professional Officer Course 
(POC) offered to selected juniors and seniors. Admission to the GMC 
is open to most U.S. citizens, male and female, over the age of 14. The 
student must be enrolled full-time in the university and registered for a 
minimum of 12 academic hours. The student spends one hour per week 
in AFROTC courses. Uniforms and AFROTC textbooks are provided 
without cost while the student is enrolled in the GMC. Enrollment of 
foreign students is governed by Air Force regulations.
 
Admission to the POC is on a competitive basis for those students 
who successfully complete the GMC. At a minimum, requirements for 
selection to the POC include successful completion of a four-week 
summer field training camp and an Air Force medical examination. The 
student must be of high moral character and demonstrate outstanding 
leadership potential. The student spends three hours per week in 
AFROTC courses. Enrollment of foreign students is governed by Air 
Force regulations.
 
For both GMC and POC, students will be required to attend weekly 
physical training (three times per week) and leadership lab (two hours per 
week). AFROTC leadership training activities are a part of each course and 
offer opportunities for practical leadership and teambuilding training and 
experience in a supervised environment. Students may also be eligible 
for different types of AFROTC scholarships. If available, scholarships may 
provide up to full college tuition, required fees, textbooks, and a monthly 
stipend. 
 
Students who successfully complete the AFROTC program and 
graduate from the University are commissioned as second lieutenants 
in the active duty U.S. Air Force. Commitment incurred is normally four 
years; however, students designated for pilot or navigator training will 
serve a longer commitment, based on the current Air Force requirements.
