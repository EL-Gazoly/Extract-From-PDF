FLM343,The French New Wave,3,"The French New Wave of the late 1950s and 1960s is largely regarded as one of the most innovative and 
influential movements in cinema history. The directors comprising the French New Wave – Francois 
Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, Agnes Varda, Eric Rohmer, and Claude Chabrol – pushed the 
limits in terms of what was possible in cinema, specifically in regards to new and fresh ways to treat film and 
narrative. To study the French New Wave is, in some ways, to study all of cinema, as the movement 
voraciously drew on the best of cinema’s past, while at the same time pointed towards cinema’s radical 
possibilities in the future. It could be argued that we are, in fact, still catching up with the New Wave 
directors spawned over six decades ago. This course will closely investigate the historical causes and formal 
advances of the French New Wave, with a particular emphasis on close readings of the filmic texts.

Christendom? Was Western Civilization liberated by Martin Luther and the reformers or crippled by them? 
When the Reformations had settled, was “religious warfare” the inevitable result? Who was at fault for the

Islamic—motivate people to kill each other? The course will explore the range of scholarly opinions on these 
questions as it surveys the history of Western Europe and its relations with the Ottoman Empire from 1350 
to 1683. The course begins with the height of medieval Europe newly threatened by the rising Ottoman 
Empire. It then transitions to the development of the three strands of the Reformation—Magisterial 
Protestants, Catholics, and Radical Reformers—that competed with one another during the European 
Reformations. Students will experience the confidence and crisis of Late Medieval Christians, follow the
