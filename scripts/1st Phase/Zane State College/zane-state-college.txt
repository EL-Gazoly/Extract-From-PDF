PHIL 1010 - Introduction to Philosophy 
(3 credit hours - 3 lecture 0 lab - G) OT36 – TMAH; TAG – OAH045 
This course begins with the most basic question of philosophy, “What should we believe?” –about God, religion, morality, politics, 
the nature of the self, the nature of the world around us, and even about knowledge itself. Students will study the process of 
figuring out what to believe—of becoming enlightened—as defined by Immanuel Kant. As Kant acknowledges, the process of 
enlightenment requires courage as it may lead us to change some of our beliefs and the process of changing one’s beliefs is often 
difficult, both intellectually and socially. In this course, students will seek answers to the previous questions, and many more, by 
looking at what philosophers throughout history have had to say about these topics. Prerequisite or co-requisite: ENGL 1500.
