3123* THE CRUSADES, 1095-1798 3 credit hours From 
the middle of the 10th century C.E. through the early 16th 
century, Europeans and the peoples of North Africa and 
the Eastern Mediterranean interacted with a greater 
intensity than ever before, inaugurating a complex history 
of interaction that has been with us ever since. In origin a 
religiously motivated enterprise on the European side 
that aimed at nothing less than the reclamation of the Holy 
Land for Christianity, the Crusades rapidly became both 
more and less than this. Less in the sense that conflict did 
not always happen for religious reasons, more in that the 
practices of crusading spread far beyond the Holy Land to 
encompass the Iberian peninsula, Eastern Europe, and, 
perhaps most ironically of all, the Christian Byzantine 
empire.  In this course we will address crusading in all of 
its forms form the High Middle Ages to the dawn of the 
Reformation. We will also seek to tell the stories of all 
involved to explore crusading as a cultural, economic, and 
social phenomenon as well as examining its more familiar 
military, religious, and political sides. In the process we 
will explore current controversies among scholars and in 
popular culture concerning what the Crusades were and 
what they mean to people today. Lecture 3 hours.

4413* RELIGION AND MAGIC IN EARLY MODERN 
EUROPE, 1400-1650 3 credit hours From the 15th to the 
mid-17th centuries, religious relationships changed 
dramatically within European societies. One path of 
change led to the Reformation, producing Protestant 
alternatives to what we now know as Catholicism. 
Another path led to bureaucratized and centralized power 
that tied community membership to shared religious 
outlooks. From care for the poor, the sick, and the elderly 
to marriage and tolerance of diversity, peoples’ lives were 
transformed, while politics took on a more religious and, 
often, deadly turn, culminating in the Thirty Years’ War. 
Perhaps the most dramatic path of all concerned the 
reform, even repression of popular religion as European 
societies attempted to root out witchcraft and newly 
vigilant and pious elites struggled to stamp out what they 
saw as superstition and worse. In this course, we explore 
these and other manifestations of the cataclysmic change 
that 
characterized 
this 
era.

4473* HEROES AND VILLAINS OF THE FRENCH 
REVOLUTION, 1780-1815 3 credit hours The French 
Revolution is, in the minds of some, the first modern 
revolution, making it one of the pivotal moments 
informing the shape of modernity. In this course we take 
a unique approach to this era by looking at the Revolution 
through the eyes of those who most influenced it. Using 
biographies, memoirs, diaries, and other first-hand 
accounts, we will explore the unfolding and wider 
implications of the French Revolution by trying to 
understand each of their particular perspectives on its 
own terms, even as we acknowledge that in an event such 
as the French Revolution, some have come down to us as 
  
 
 
heroic figures and some as villains. Lecture 3 hours.
