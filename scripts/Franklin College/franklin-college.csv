BUS 380 Econometrics",,4,"Spring 
 
Prereq: ECO 115 and MAT/PSY/SOC 224, or consent 
of instructor 
This course is designed for students who obtained basic statistical concept and elementary econometrics 
through MAT 224.  The course provides students with an advanced level of research methodology to 
analyze business and economic problems.  The course focuses on departing Gauss-Markov assumptions 
and learning non-linear regression model, time series (including serial correlation), panel data, 
simultaneous equations model, and generalized least squares (GLS) methodology, so that students can 
conduct research analysis correctly.  During the course students will use actual data of business and/or 
economics to conduct a research analysis, for which students use the statistical software, R.  Same as ECO 
380."

AST 110 Astronomy",,4,"Fall, odd academic years 
Scientific Thinking exploratory 
 
The course will provide an overview of our modern understanding of the universe at an elementary level.  Students 
will learn how following the Big Bang, elements were formed and hence the existence of all that is in the universe 
has been made possible.  Special topics will include the Big Bang, solar system, planets and evidence of life on other 
planets, stars, galaxies, black holes, dark matter, dark energy, and expansion of the universe.  This is an introductory 
course and no prior math experience is necessary.  The course, therefore, starts out with a discussion of basic 
mathematical thinking necessary for a few portions of the course.  The class will travel to various local astronomical 
sites observatories."
