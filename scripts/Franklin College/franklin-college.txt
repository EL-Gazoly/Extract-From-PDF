systems in a variety of ways.  This data-driven discrimination can compound problems for society’s most vulnerable 
groups, leading to increased polarization and inequality.  In this course, students will learn about some of the ways 
in which data are currently used to make decisions, reflect on the possible ramifications of those decisions, examine 
which groups of people may be disproportionately alienated or harmed by the processes, and discuss how to 
approach data projects from an equity perspective.

Political Science 
 
Department Chair: R. Smith 
Department Members: A. Fetter-Harrott, R. Smith 
 
Major: Political Science, Political Economy 
Minors: Political Science, International Relations, Political Economy 
 
The political science department provides the means by which, within the liberal arts curriculum, undergraduate 
students learn to understand the political process (at both domestic and international levels.)  The place of political 
science in a liberal arts setting has been established for the better part of 3,000 years.  The department offers two 
sets of courses: one concerned with international politics, and another concerned with American politics.  Like the 
ancient Greek philosophers, political science is concerned both with understanding and evaluating the processes 
which allocate societal values.  In so doing, our students will be able to appreciate and understand these two levels 
of the political process. The department offers core coursework within two majors, which each focus on different 
aspects of the study of politics. 
 
The major in Political Science builds from a core academic and philosophical examination of politics through to 
practical application. Students majoring in Political Science live the connection between theory and practice as they 
explore the interplay of politics/law in their choice of an immersive learning experience. Throughout the rest of the 
curriculum students expand upon this knowledge and experience base to build a formidable resume that includes 
completion of their own independent research prior to graduation.  As a result of this training, students will be able 
to think analytically about the problems that face humankind internationally and domestically.  They will be 
prepared for such things as law school, graduate school, employment by government at the local, state, and federal 
levels, as well as careers in teaching. 
 
All political science majors and minors must earn a grade of C- or better in all required political science courses. 
Students majoring in political science must complete the 29 semester hours of political science with a minimum 
graduation GPA of 2.00 (A=4.00). Students wishing to minor in political science or international relations must 
complete all required courses with a minimum graduation GPA of 2.00 (A=4.00). 
 
The major in Political Economy is Franklin College’s interdisciplinary major. Coursework within the major examines 
the relationship between politics and economics in modern societies and focuses on problems of both domestic 
and international policy. Students majoring in Political Economy study the political and economic factors that affect, 
and are affected by, systems of production, exchange, and distribution. That is, political economy majors analyze 
how international and domestic political factors interact with micro- and macro-economic factors to determine 
outcomes in a wide variety of areas including globalization, international trade and finance, regulation, 
development, taxes, and income distribution. As a result, students will be able to think logically and analytically 
about the problems that face humankind internationally and domestically. They will be prepared for law school, 
graduate school and employment by private sectors and government at the local, state, and federal levels, as well 
as careers in teaching. 
 
All political economy majors and minors must earn a grade of C- or better in all required coursework for the major, 
minor and related field.  Students majoring in political economy must complete the all required major/minor 
courses with a minimum graduation GPA of 2.00 (A=4.00).. Furthermore, regardless of major, all students taking 
economics courses must complete all prerequisites with a C- or better.

Program Information: Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior. Even the most introverted, isolated 
individuals must interact with others at some point; nobody is exempt from the findings of the field of psychology. 
Because most people interact with others regularly, most people use psychology on a daily basis whether they are 
aware of it or not. Findings from the field of psychology can be applicable to a broad range of occupations and roles, 
from managers to teachers to parents. Thus, psychology provides the insight to better understand ourselves and 
our wide network of relationships.  
 
Operating within the strong liberal arts structure at Franklin College, the Psychology Program communicates to 
students that psychology offers unique ways of thinking and knowing, which have great potential for helping people 
identify and cope with the world’s problems. Additionally, the program aims to develop in students the compassion, 
command and comprehension they will need to work toward making the world a better place for all individuals to 
lead satisfying and productive lives.  
 
The Psychology Program strives to:  
• provide students with a broad and deep knowledge base in psychology  
• engage students in practical applications of that knowledge base  
• enable students to develop methodological competence and ethical sensitivity  
• encourage students to play an active role in their education both inside and  
outside of the classroom.  
 
 
All major and minor courses and prerequisites must be completed with a grade of C- or better.

Cooperative Programs in Psychology  
Franklin College offers an accelerated Master of Public Health (AMPH) in the form of a 3 + 2 combined Bachelor of 
Arts (3) and Master of Public Health (2) degree with the IUPUI Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health. This 
consists of a common core and specific courses required for each particular program. After completion of three

completion of one of the two required diversity and international courses), students may receive a bachelor of arts 
degree from Franklin College upon completing one year at IUPUI, for a total of 120 semester hours. Successful 
completion of the first year in the cooperative program satisfies the internship or senior year experience 
requirement for the major. Any student following these programs who is not accepted by IUPUI after the third year 
could return to Franklin College and receive a bachelor of arts in psychology by completing: 1) all of the remaining 
requirements for the psychology major, 2) one additional diversity or international course, and 3) 120 total 
semester hours required for graduation. (Students with a declared enrollment in the aforementioned cooperative 
program will be given priority during registration in subsequent semester(s)).  See the Public Health section of this 
catalog for more details.

rooted in the liberal arts tradition of Aristotle's Rhetoric teachings, PR has become an engaging, fast-paced, 
demanding and strategically sophisticated profession that today uses multi-media communications tactics and 
technologies.  
 
Hallmarks of the profession include, but are certainly not limited to, a) a commitment to freedom of speech and 
expression; b) clear, concise and compelling writing; c) an understanding of and appreciation for journalism's role 
in a democracy; d) appreciation of and commitment to multicultural awareness; e) mass media literacy; f) critical 
thinking and problem-solving skills; g) adherence to the codes of ethics of the Public Relations Society of America 
and the International Association of Business Communicators.  
 
Students pursue in-depth academic studies of public relations while also gaining real-world, real-time learning 
experiences. Graduates are well prepared to launch careers in public relations and related fields. The public 
relations major also serves students who plan to pursue graduate or professional degrees in communications or 
other areas. The public relations program encourages students to explore possibilities for double majors, and also 
possibilities for study abroad and study away experiences.
