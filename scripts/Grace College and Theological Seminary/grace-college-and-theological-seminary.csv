PRE-LAW MINOR 
Our pre-law program complements virtually any major including those preferred by many law schools 
and the American Bar Association (such as history, political science, communication, English, business, 
criminal justice, psychology, information technology, mathematics, biology, and Spanish). The ABA and 
most law schools do NOT recommend that pre-law students take a pre-law major - therefore, we do not 
offer one at Grace. In addition to their major advisor, students are assigned a pre-law advisor.  
Students must complete 21 credit hours for this minor.

Modern Languages Program Director or Institute for Global Studies. Study Abroad Program locations 
and institutions are subject to change, based upon availability. 
 
Language students are required to take the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPIc) to evaluate their 
proficiency in their target language. For students in the language education program, the minimum level 
for graduation is Advanced Low. 
Bachelor of Arts Language Requirement 
The Bachelor of Arts degree requires that students demonstrate proficiency in a single language. This 
may be accomplished in the following ways: 
● Students complete two courses (6 hours) in a single modern or ancient language (e.g., Spanish, 
French, Hebrew, Greek, or any language currently offered through Go Study or Go Exchange). 
Students with prior language instruction and/or strong language skills may take the online 
Foreign Language Placement Exam (FLPE) to determine in which course level to enroll. 
● Students who place into the 2020-level of a language (e.g., SPA 2020) based on the online 
Foreign Language Placement Exam (FLPE) may contact the Modern Languages Program Director 
and arrange to take the department exam. The fee for the department exam is $120. Students 
who score in the “Intermediate Mid” level on the department exam may receive credit for 2010 
(3 hours), and enroll in 2020 (3 hours) to satisfy the B.A. language requirement. Students

and 2020,"(6 hours), thereby satisfying the B.A. language requirement. Students wishing to ",3,"pursue this option should schedule the department exam within the first four weeks of their 
first semester at Grace College and Seminary. 
● Students may earn language credits based on their Advanced Placement (AP) language exam 
score. Students with a score of 4 or 5 on an AP language exam receive credit for 1020 (3 hours) 
and enroll in 2010 to satisfy the B.A. language requirement.  
Foreign Language Placement Examination (FLPE)  
Students with previous language experience in Spanish or French should complete the Foreign Language 
Placement Examination (FLPE) prior to arriving on campus. There is no cost for the placement exam. Go 
to http://bit.ly/2P9yP76. You will need to enter your Grace Student ID. Each question is selected based 
on previous responses and the test is usually completed within 30 to 45 minutes. Please note that the 
online Foreign Language Placement Exam (FLPE) is a placement exam only; no credits will be awarded 
based on the FLPE.  
 
Department Exam 
Students who place into or beyond the 2020-level on the Foreign Language Placement Examination 
(FLPE) may contact the Modern Languages Program Director to arrange to take the department exam, 
which is the ACTFL OPIc. Unlike the FLPE, the department exam is a credit-bearing exam that tests oral 
proficiency. The fee for the department exam is $120. Students who score in the “Intermediate Mid” 
level on the department exam receive credit for 2010 (3 credits). Students who score in the 
“Intermediate High” level receive credit for 2010 and 2020 (6 credits). Students who score below the 
“Intermediate Mid” level on the department exam receive no credits. Students must schedule the 
department exam within the first four weeks of their first semester at Grace College and Seminary. 
 
CLEP Examination  
CLEP Examination Credits may not be used to satisfy the B.A. language requirement. Students who 
complete a foreign language CLEP exam will receive general elective credit that will count toward overall 
credits needed to graduate.  
 
International Students and Foreign Transfer Credits 
Students who have received the equivalent of a high school diploma in a country in which the primary 
language is other than English may be granted the language requirement for a B.A. through transfer 
credits. In order to receive the 6 transfer credits, students must submit the foreign high school transcript 
to the Modern Languages Program Director for approval. 
Modern Languages Majors 
The French and Spanish majors provide an opportunity for focused study in a single language. The 
requirement for the language majors is 40-42 credit hours in the department. A minor is required. For 
most language majors, at least 12 credit hours must be taken through an approved study abroad 
program.

Communication Program 
The Communication Program promotes awareness of the complexities of the human communication 
process, cultivation of communication skills, and the free and responsible use of communication abilities 
and mediums. The study of communication is ideal for students who are considering occupation as a 
communication specialist at any size or type of organization or in preparation for graduate work. The 
major is also beneficial for those considering work in public relations, management, human resources, 
missions, journalism, counseling, marketing, consulting, law, media communications, personnel 
management, or ministry. 
The program consists of a variety of majors and minors that approach the discipline through different 
methodologies. The communication foundation of each major introduces students to the theories and 
techniques of modern communication and prepares them for communicative competency with a wide 
array of media, audiences, and purposes. Majors include communication, professional communication, 
and digital communication. All communication majors select three credits of experiential learning, such 
as an internship or workshop. Communication majors may be pursued as part of a B.A. or B.S. degree. 
Minors offered through the Communication Program include public relations, communication, digital 
communication, political communication, and international communication.  
 
Program Learning Outcomes 
1. Students become critical thinkers who appreciate complexity and deliberation, and who 
respond to ideas with an acknowledgement of personal bias, and personal ethics. 
2. Students appropriately adapt their written and oral communication for various audiences, 
genres, media, and purposes.

The Department of Graduate Counseling (DOGC) Catalog and Student Handbook is part of the larger 
Grace College and Seminary 2023 -2025 Academic Catalog. Students enrolled in the DOGC Clinical 
Mental Health Counseling (CMHC) program are responsible for information contained within both the 
Grace Academic Catalog and the DOGC Catalog.  Both catalogs contain policies relevant to the 
institution as a whole as well as to the specific department and program in which students are 
enrolled.   
In addition to the DOGC catalog, students enrolled in courses may be provided with additional 
information from the School of Professional and Online Education (SPOE).  This information may cover, 
but is not limited to, specific processes and procedures related to The DOGC program of study from 
application to graduation. 
Note about the DOGC Catalog                                                                                                                    
The DOGC Catalog is updated bi-annually and it is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with the 
contents of the catalog for the current academic year.  While every effort is made to provide accurate 
and current information within the Grace College academic catalogs and website, the institution 
reserves the right to change, without notice, statements in the catalog concerning rules, policies, fees, 
curricula, courses, or other matters.  Changes to an academic catalog that are necessary following the 
start of the fall semester will be noted as an addendum to the original catalog.  
The provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded 
as a contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies 
governing admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. 
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student. 
See also the Introduction section to the Grace College and Theological Seminary 2023-2025 Catalog. 
Archived catalogs are maintained on the institution’s website. 
 
IMPORTANT:  It is each student’s responsibility to schedule regular meetings with their academic 
advisor and to be knowledgeable about institutional requirements, academic regulations, and 
calendar deadlines specified in the catalogs and academic program publications.

Grace College Mission Statement                                                                                                         
Grace College is an evangelical Christian community of higher education which applies biblical values in 
strengthening character, sharpening competence, and preparing for service. 
DOGC Purpose Statement                                                                                                                           
The DOGC is committed to providing graduate level programming that equips students to be Scripturally 
grounded, professionally skilled, and interpersonally competent as they actively engage in the 
counseling profession and its related ministries. The purpose of the CMHC degree is to prepare students 
for future licensure in clinical mental health counseling.  
Programmatic Commitments                                                                                                                      
The graduate program offered by the DOGC is committed to the following goals as they relate to 
counselor education and supervision and/or counseling-related ministries: 
1. Scripturally Grounded: A commitment to Scripture as the foundation of truth in each course with a 
complimentary understanding of the truths is psychology and the social sciences. 
2. Professionally Skilled: A commitment to the professional and clinical development of the counselor-
in-training as an essential element for effective practice. 
3. Interpersonally Competent: A commitment to the interpersonal growth of the counselor-in-training 
as an essential element for effective practice. 
The DOGC’s purpose statement and programmatic commitments are reflected in the classroom, 
supervisory situations, and clinical settings. DOGC students receive a solid biblical foundation within each 
class curriculum. This theological education serves as an essential basis for understanding self, others, and 
God. DOGC students are equipped with a thorough understanding of counseling ethics, diagnosis, theory, 
and clinical issues, as well as trained to be professionally competent in clinical settings. DOGC students are 
also required to have sessions of professional counseling in an endeavor to wrestle with personal issues and 
more effectively understand and assist clients. 
Programmatic Assumptions                                                                                                                        
The CMHC program requires student adherence to both scriptural and professional codes related to the 
protection and preservation of human welfare and dignity.  DOGC students are therefore bound by the 
ethical standards for the practice of counseling as defined by the American Counseling Association (ACA) 
and the American Association of Christian Counselors (AACC).  When ethical principles vary between 
these two organizations, the DOGC will trend toward the most stringent ethical principle.  Further, 
DOGC students abide by the standards and expectations outlined in the Code of Conduct Policy section 
of this catalog.

the Master of Arts degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling to graduate students who seek to 
become professional counselors.  This program of study is focused on promoting students’ personal, 
professional, and spiritual growth with a commitment to scripture as the foundation of truth and the 
basis for considering the truth found in psychological principles. The MA in CMHC is offered through an 
online platform.  
The DOGC program provides an opportunity for students to obtain a graduate degree in the counseling 
profession utilizing the flexibility of online education.  Students enrolled in the program receive support 
from the School of Professional and Online Education (SPOE) at Grace College. The DOGC’s program 
offers all of the CMHC courses virtually. Students enrolled in the online learning platform also attend 7-
day residencies or “intensives” each year at a designated location, typically the Grace College campus in 
Winona Lake, Indiana. This residency requirement allows students to benefit from face-to-face 
instruction, academic advising, and supervision from program faculty, and promotes critical relational 
interactions between faculty, students, and administrators that builds relationships and provides 
support to counterbalance the rigor and intensity of a graduate counseling program. The program offers 
graduate students an opportunity to earn a degree without relocating and may be especially appealing 
to individuals who want or need the flexibility of an online, non-resident program to meet their current 
commitments to family or job. 
 
Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling CACREP-Accredited Degree  
The M.A. CMHC degree is a 60-hour program for those entering the mental health counseling field 
and/or for those wanting to pursue their doctoral degree in counseling. The CMHC program prepares 
graduates to work as professional and clinical mental health counselors in a wide variety of settings by 
providing the learner with both didactic (in the classroom) and clinical (in the field) experiences 
throughout their schedule of study. The CMHC curriculum blends psychological and theological 
principles within each course in an effort to promote the development of each student’s clinical skills 
and Christian faith.    
IMPORTANT:  While the CMHC program is designed to meet the educational standards for licensure in 
the state of Indiana, graduating from the CMHC program does not guarantee licensure in the United 
States or any other country.  Students are responsible for understanding the particular laws and 
statutes governing licensure as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Professional 
Counselor (LPC), or equivalent in their state of residency post-graduation.  For more information about 
state licensure, please see the DOGC website and find the state licensure requirement document..   
Programmatic Accreditation                                                                                                                               
The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), which is a 
specialized accrediting body recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), has 
granted accreditation to the Grace College Department of Graduate Counseling for the M.A. in Clinical 
Mental Health Counseling degree. For more information on CACREP accreditation, please click here. 
IMPORTANT:  CACREP accreditation does not guarantee a student’s ability to obtain licensure as an 
LMHC, LPC, or equivalent in the United States or any other country.  Students are responsible for 
researching and understanding how CACREP impacts the practice of counseling and obtaining 
licensure in their desired state of residency post-graduation.

The DOGC develops and administers program policy and works with an advisory board that assists in 
reviewing program data and making recommendations for improvement. The board is comprised of 
up to ten (10) members including DOGC faculty, current students, program alumni, clinical site 
supervisors, and employers. The purpose of the advisory board is to engage with various stakeholders 
in program evaluation of the Department of Graduate Counseling. The advisory board meets semi-
annually or more often as required in order to review assessment data and program processes.  
Program Evaluation 
The DOGC develops and provides graduate level programming utilizing best practices for clinical 
counseling instruction and adhering to the CACREP standards of counselor education. The DOGC 
evaluates its program and policies on a continual basis using a variety of processes, including weekly 
faculty meetings, the self-study and peer-review CACREP accreditation process, engagement with 
various stakeholders through an established advisory board, and the analysis of quantitative and 
qualitative data gathered from student assessments. In addition to course evaluations and post-
residency evaluations, students in the DOGC program complete program evaluation assessments each 
Spring. This data is reviewed by DOGC faculty and the DOGC Advisory Board. The DOGC program may 
choose to make programmatic or policy changes using data gathered through these multiple 
assessment processes.  
Programmatic Changes Policy                                                                                                                    
The DOGC may choose to add or delete courses to schedules of study from time to time.  Students 
enrolled in a DOGC degree program over several years may be required to change their academic plan 
due to updated schedules of study or course changes.  Students will work with their individual advisors 
to ensure that they have met all requirements for graduation under the following stipulations: 
1. The original numerical requirements for course credit hours must remain the same as stated in the 
catalog under which the student entered into the program.  The program may not add to the credit 
hour requirement unless the student is in a remedial situation that is clearly documented. 
2. Students may not take more credit hours than required by their DOGC program schedule of study 
without written approval from the DOGC chair.  IMPORTANT:  Financial aid will not be available for 
courses taken outside of the student’s approved DOGC degree program. 
Course Availability Policy

DOGC Admissions Policy                                                                                                                    
Admission requirements to The DOGC program have been developed with the applicant, the program, 
and the counseling profession in mind. Due to the competitive nature of the application process for 
the CMHC program and our CACREP accreditation, admission requirements are designed to allow the 
DOGC Admissions Committee to determine the suitability for each applicant as a future mental health 
counselor. As such, the DOGC Admissions Committee makes admission decisions using both 
quantitative and qualitative assessments. 
Admission Components                                                                                                                                
In accordance with the institution’s non-discrimination policy, each applicant is considered upon his/her 
own merit regardless of sex, race, color, national and ethnic origin, handicap, denomination, or church 
affiliation. Grace College does not discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities in the 
recruitment and admission of students. Grace College is committed to compliance with the Title IX of 
the federal education amendments of 1972 except as claimed in a filed religious exemption. 
Application materials are available from the Office of Graduate and Adult Enrollment. Admissions forms

for the counseling profession. Please ask someone in the Graduate and Online Admissions Office any 
questions you may have about the admissions process, even if you are not yet ready to apply. The 
faculty want you to be comfortable with the process and confident to proceed. 
In addition, the application and forms may be printed from PDF files on the web site or obtained from 
the department and submitted by mail to the Graduate and Online Admissions Office, 1 Lancer Way, 
Winona Lake, IN  46590. Admission forms may also be obtained by emailing: 
onlineadmissions@grace.edu. Applicants should review the admission forms, complete and submit all 
application materials and forms for review by faculty no later than March 15 for summer semester, July 
1 for the fall semester, and November 15 for the spring semester. Admission priority will be given to full-
time students. Applicants who are not declined at this stage, but are not among those initially selected, 
will be put on a waiting list and will be notified if a space becomes available. 
Once the completed admissions paperwork is received, the admissions team determines if the applicant 
meets the basic requirements of GPA and degree qualifications for admission. At that point, an interview 
will be scheduled with an appointed DOGC faculty member. After the interview has been completed, the 
Admissions Committee will review the applicant file and a decision regarding the applicant will be 
rendered. 
Notification of Admissions Decision                                                                                                
Students are notified in writing of admissions decisions made by the DOGC Admissions Committee.  The 
DOGC Admissions Committee decisions are final and not subject to appeal.  Applicants who have been 
denied admission may reapply after the passage of one calendar year from the date of denial by 
submitting all documents required of a new applicant. 
Admission Acceptance Status                                                                                                                 
Upon acceptance, students are mailed an acceptance letter with admissions provisions, if any. The letter 
notifies students of the tuition deposit due to allow course registration.  Acceptance into the DOGC 
program is valid for up to one calendar year from the original term of intended enrollment.  Applicants 
who defer their enrollment into the CMHC program beyond one calendar year must re-apply for 
admissions following the latest admissions requirements.  
Accepted applicants into the DOGC will be assigned one of the following statuses by the DOGC 
Admissions Committee: 
1. Regular Academic Status 
The student is accepted into full academic standing in the department without conditions and is 
expected to maintain a 3.0 GPA prior to graduation. 
2. Provisional Acceptance Status 
Applicants granted Provisional Acceptance will be notified by the DOGC Admissions Committee of 
the specific provisions, restrictions or contingencies that must be satisfied prior to the student’s 
participation in the CMHC program. These provisions may include but are not limited to completing 
additional coursework, providing an additional writing sample, and submitting additional 
references.

Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 13

Applicants granted Conditional Acceptance will be allowed to enroll in classes with the 
understanding that the admissions committee will review progress after the first semester of 
academic work. At that time, the Admissions Committee will fully admit the student into the 
program, extend the conditional admission for one semester, or admission could be denied.  
Pending Acceptance                                                                                                                           
Applicants who meet the Admissions Requirements for the DOGC program may be granted a Pending 
Acceptance status based on their partially submitted application.  The DOGC Admissions Committee 
and/or Department Chair will determine pending acceptance on a case by case basis. 
Denial of Admission

Criminal background check reveals felony and/or serious misdemeanor conviction and/or 
arrest. 
• 
Personal Interview reveals problems with interpersonal skills and/or lack of suitability for 
graduate-level study or the counseling profession. 
• 
Career Goal Statement is written poorly and/or does not indicate goals relevant to the 
counseling profession or the Christian faith. 
• 
Demonstrating actions that are inconsistent with the ACA and AACC Code of Ethics. 
• 
Demonstrating a lack of motivation for the counseling profession. 
• 
Gross violation of the Department of Graduate Counseling’s Standards of Conduct.  
Unclassified Students (nonclinical classes)                                                                                            
An individual who would like to take courses as an unclassified student must complete the 
Unclassified Student Application form and Professional  Reference form available 
online and from the Office of Graduate and Adult Enrollment. An unclassified student who desires to 
pursue a CMHC degree must complete and submit a full application to the School of Professional and 
Online Education.  
 An unclassified student is limited to a maximum of nine (9) credit hours and may register for any of the 
following courses: Theological Foundations of Counseling (CPY5050), Foundations of CMHC (CPY5100), 
Social and Cultural Issues (CPY6500), Personality and Counseling Theories (CPY5200), Research and 
Program Evaluation (CPY5592), Gender and Sexuality (CPY5750), or Ethical and Legal Issues (CPY6200).  
Unclassified students may not take courses other than those listed here.  Please note: courses are 
designed for students pursuing a clinical mental health counseling degree and those who wish to take 
CMHC courses as an unclassified student should be aware that if they do not have a background in 
behavioral science or counseling, they may not be successful in the course.  Students currently enrolled 
in the CMHC program are given first priority in registering for classes and therefore not all classes will 
have openings for unclassified students.

IMPORTANT: Individuals applying as unclassified students are not guaranteed acceptance into CMHC 
courses. An applicant who has been denied acceptance to the DOGC is not eligible to take courses in 
the DOGC as an unclassified student unless the admissions committee has given approval.   
Grace College Undergraduates Desiring to Take DOGC Courses 
1. Undergraduates may not take graduate courses for undergraduate credit. 
2. Undergraduates may take a limited number of graduate counseling classes for graduate credit 
as unclassified students. This credit cannot be applied to satisfy undergraduate requirements. 
3. Grace College seniors may apply to the DOGC as unclassified students in their final semester. 
These students may take up to 6 credits in the graduate counseling program as unclassified 
graduate students during their final semester. 
4. Students must have approval for graduate counseling courses from the DOGC Chair before 
registering for classes. Only unclassified courses may be taken by undergraduate seniors.  
5. Tuition charges will follow one of two options: 
a.) Block pricing will be applied for students who take 12 undergraduate credits with 
additional graduate credits. Under this option, students will qualify for full Grace financial 
aid. Students can take up to 6 graduate credits under block pricing. 
b.) Students taking fewer than 12 undergraduate credit hours will be charged according to 
the per credit hour tuition rate (1-11 credits) and could receive prorated Grace financial 
aid.  
This unclassified status does not guarantee acceptance into the graduate program. Students must 
go through the entire acceptance process and will be evaluated in exactly the same way as any 
other applicant. 
International Student Policy                                                                                                         
International Students who wish to take classes in the Department of Graduate Counseling should be 
aware that they must reside in the U.S. for the duration of all clinical courses. International applicants 
need to go through the normal procedure for admission to the DOGC. Applicants that do not speak 
English as a first language and have not attended an English-speaking undergraduate program should 
take the TOEFL exam or equivalent as determined by admissions and submit the scores to Admissions.  
Applicants with transcripts from non-U.S. undergraduate programs will be evaluated for equivalency to 
determine GPA. If GPA cannot be adequately determined, the applicant may not be admitted to the 
program or may be admitted conditionally until academic readiness can be clearly determined.  
U.S. Citizens Living Abroad 
Important: United States citizens living abroad may take didactic courses online. However, all fieldwork 
courses (Practicum, Internship, and Advanced Internship) must be completed at approved clinical sites 
within the United States or recognized United States military installations.  It is the student’s 
responsibility to identify potential clinical sites, submit sites for approval to the Clinical Coordinator, and 
make arrangements with site supervisors to complete administrative paperwork and develop a plan to 
meet course requirements.

Academic Policies Related to the DOGC Program                                                                         
Policies related to course enrollment, advising, appeals, graduation, and other academic requests and 
procedures are available in the Grace College Academic Policies Manual.  The following policies are 
supplemental to those found in the Grace College Academic Policies Manual. Students enrolled in the 
DOGC program are responsible for reading and understanding academic policies housed in both the 
Grace College and DOGC Catalogs. 
Grading Policy                                                                                                                                         
Students will be assigned a final grade or symbol (CR, NC, I) by the date published in the academic 
calendar each semester. The DOGC CMHC program utilizes the following grading scale to calculate 
grades and student GPA across courses within the CMHC curriculum (Pass/Fail or Credit/No-credit 
courses excluded): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. The student’s grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of quality points 
earned in the DOGC by the total number of semester hours attempted (excluding courses 
bearing a grade of “W” and repeated courses).  
2. In several courses, a Credit/No Credit system is also used (See Credit/No Credit Policy for 
Counseling Skills and Practicum and Credit/No Credit Policy for Internship and Advanced 
Internship). 
3. An Incomplete (“I”) indicates the failure to complete a portion of a course’s requirements and 
may be assigned only in cases of serious illness or other emergency. The incomplete grade is 
considered temporary and students must make up the work without repeating the course. The 
incomplete grade must be replaced with a letter grade by the date specified by the professor, or 
it will become an “F” if not responded to within six (6) weeks after the close of the semester. 
4. At the end of each semester, students can visit the Portal on the Grace College website 
(www.grace.edu) to check their grades. When a final grade has been reported to the registrar, it 
cannot be changed except by the professor within the specified dates on the academic calendar. 
All indebtedness to the college must be satisfied before a transcript of record will be issued.

(83%) or higher and a GPA of 3.0. in order to graduate from the program. Grades of “B-” or below are 
considered failing; and the student must successfully repeat these courses the next time the course is 
offered.   
Course grades of B- or below are considered “Failing” and indicate that the student is not progressing 
satisfactorily, and attention must be paid to academic or other issues related to the student’s 
achievement. Students who fall below a 3.0 GPA in one term will be placed on Academic Probation. 
Students who receive a B- or below in a course will receive a Professional Development Notification 
(PDN). If a student receives 2 PDNs, then he or she is referred to the Student Professional Development 
Committee (SPDC).  Each student’s academic status is determined at the end of every term based on the 
following criteria:   
1. Regular Academic Status – Students who earn grades “B” (83%) or higher in their DOGC 
coursework, maintain a 3.0 GPA, and receive satisfactory faculty evaluations will be considered on 
Regular Academic Status.  This status allows DOGC students to continue matriculating in their 
degree program without restriction.   
2. Academic Probation – Students who receive a grade of “B- “or below or a No Credit in Counseling 
Skills, Practicum, Internship, or Advanced Internship courses and/or fall below a 3.0 Term GPA will 
be placed on Academic Probation following the term in which either of these occurred. Students on 
Academic Probation must meet with their academic advisor to discuss remediating academic 
deficiencies. Students on Academic Probation must successfully pass with a “B” or higher all courses 
within the next term and earn a 3.0 term GPA in order to return to Regular Academic Status.  
3. Academic Dismissal – Students who earn two grades of “B- “or below, earn a grade of No Credit 
twice in Counseling Skills, Practicum, Internship, or Advanced Internship courses, or exhibit 
professional, ethical, or other interpersonal concerns that may affect their academic grades will be 
referred to the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC). The SPDC will review the 
student’s progress in the program and professional counseling competencies for determination of 
remediation or dismissal.   
Full Time & Part Time Status                                                                                                                       
For the 2023-2025 academic years, students enrolled in a minimum of six (6) credit hours of CMHC 
coursework in a given semester are considered “full-time” and eligible for financial aid as such. Students 
enrolled in a minimum of three (3) credit hours of CMHC coursework in a given semester are considered 
“part-time” and eligible for financial aid as such.  Additional questions related to financial aid, including

but not limited to, when financial monies are given out each year, can be directed to the Grace College 
Financial Aid office at 1-800-544-7223, ext. 6162. 
Attendance Policy                                                                                                                                   
Because classroom discussions and activities are collaborative and essential to the learning of counseling 
competencies, it is critical that students attend every class. It is the policy of the DOGC that absences 
due to illness (verified by a doctor’s note) or death of a family member are excused absences. Most 
other absences are not excused. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor in advance 
and obtain approval prior to missing a class or course requirement. If an emergency arises which makes 
advance notice of absence impossible, students are expected to notify the instructor by email, text, or 
phone call as soon as reasonably possible.   
Attendance in all DOGC courses includes the student’s presence and active participation in classroom 
sessions. Attendance and participation include the use of operable web-cameras, integrated 
microphone headsets, as well as participating in the synchronous and asynchronous classroom activities 
and discussions. All courses have a minimum requirement for synchronous classroom meetings. 
 
Non-Clinical Courses 
Faculty members determine the attendance policies in courses for which they are responsible, provide 
students with information describing their attendance policies, and determine the penalty for students 
who fail to attend class according to these stated policies. 
1. Students are expected to attend faithfully every course in which they are enrolled. 
2. Students should consult the attendance policy of the professor of record to determine policies, 
responsibilities, and penalties for excused and unexcused absences for individual courses. 
Clinical Courses 
Attendance at clinical sites and faculty and site supervision is mandatory. Any unexcused absence may 
result in a “No Credit” for the course. 
Residency 
Students are required to attend and earn a Credit for Residency each year they are enrolled and actively 
taking classes in the CMHC program. In extreme circumstances, students who can’t attend Residency 
due to health concerns, death in the family, or other matters that would cause extreme hardship for the 
student may apply for a waiver, first through their advisor, then to the DOGC Department Chair. The 
decision rendered by the Chair will be final. If a waiver is granted, the student may be able to take 
didactic courses in the next academic year but may not take clinical courses. 
 
Practicum and Internship Orientations 
Students taking clinical classes must be adequately prepared for working in the field. Therefore, all 
Orientation meetings for Practicum and Internship are considered mandatory. Students who do not 
attend these meetings will be given remedial work as determined by the Clinical Coordinator to acquire 
the information needed to work in the field.  Students who do not complete the remedial work will not 
be allowed to work at a clinical site until the remedial work has been completed.   
 
Additional Academic Requirements 
Orientation to Clinical Mental Health Counseling 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 18 
 June 2023 
 
The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) is the primary 
accreditor for the Grace College Clinical Mental Health Counseling program.  CACREP standards require 
all students entering the CMHC program to have a new student orientation prior to or at the beginning 
of the first term they are registered for classes. For this reason, all students must complete CPY5005 
Orientation to CMHC prior to or concurrently with courses taken in their first session in the program. 
Students who do not receive a Credit for this course may not register for subsequent courses until this 
program requirement is met.    
 
Degree Audit Form 
Students are required to meet with their academic advisors prior to or within the first few weeks of their 
first session in the CMHC program to complete and sign a Degree Audit Form. This form is written 
documentation of the student’s schedule of study and outlines the student’s expected progression 
through the CMHC program. For this reason, students who have not completed this requirement are not 
allowed to continue or register for courses past the first session of the program.  In addition, all students 
are required to meet with their advisors annually to review and submit an updated Degree Audit Form.   
 
Academic Advising 
Upon acceptance to the CMHC program, each student is assigned a faculty advisor who will remain the 
students’ academic advisor throughout the entire program unless otherwise notified.  Academic 
advisors serve as the student’s first source of information related to understanding program policies and 
procedures. Additionally, the advisor serves as a mentor in discussing course progression and sharing 
celebrations and concerns that the student experiences during their program.  During times when a 
student has difficulty meeting an academic or behavioral competency, as outlined in the DOGC Catalog’s 
Academic and Professional Retention Policy, or receives a Notice of Concern (NOC) or Professional 
Development Notification (PDN), the advisor acts as a coach to assist the student in remediating 
identified concerns. Advisors also act as an accountability source when a student experiences difficulty 
meeting academic or professional competencies and needs assistance. In these situations, the student 
should contact their advisor for help in formulating a plan that enhances the student’s success in the 
program.  
 
If a student receives a Professional Development Notification (PDN), the person issuing the PDN will 
include a specific plan for remediation.  The student and their advisor will review the plan and may add 
additional objectives and interventions to assist the student in meeting the competency goals. The 
student’s advisor is responsible for monitoring the remediation plan with the student, communicating 
with the student that the student is passing, failing, or has failed to reach desired improvements, and for 
imposing the specific consequences identified in the plan. The student’s advisor will also communicate 
with the person who issued the PDN. Failure to complete a remediation plan will result in referral to the 
SPDC Committee.  
 
When a student receives a Notice of Concern or experiences difficulty in meeting academic or 
professional competencies, the student should work to develop a plan to enhance the students’ success 
in the program.  The student’s advisor is available to consult with the student in creation of this plan and 
can serve as an accountability source for the student.  The collaborative plan for success should (a) 
communicate specific desired improvements, (b) actions the student will take to meet these goals, (c) 
specific dates for follow-up and review with the advisor, and (d) identify the consequences for failing to 
reach the student’s desired goals.

Registration                                                                                                                                                     
To register for the first semester of study, students will work with the School of Professional and Online 
Education and their advisor. Subsequent registration for courses will be completed by DOGC students 
through the Grace College Portal.   
Statement on Disabilities                                                                                                                             
A student with a documented disability is entitled by law to accommodations for the disability. 
Accommodations provide students with disabilities an equal opportunity to be successful by reducing or 
removing the barriers that may be caused by a disability and a traditional academic environment. Grace 
College seeks to provide reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities (e.g., 
attention, health, hearing, learning, mobility, physical, psychiatric, or vision).  Students with a 
documented disability or special learning need should contact Connie Burkholder, Coordinator of 
Student Disability Services at x6423, via email at burkhoc@grace.edu or stop by the Learning Center, 
located in Morgan library, for assistance. Students with a disability will be assisted by the Learning 
Center in requesting approved accommodations in their courses.  Adequate time must be allowed to 
arrange accommodations and accommodations are not retroactive; therefore, students with disabilities 
should contact the Coordinator as soon as possible in the session for which they are seeking 
accommodations. The law states that college personnel, including field instructors, cannot ask a student 
if he/she has a disability. Therefore, if a student would like accommodations for any classes, it is the 
student’s responsibility to inform their course instructors of any approved accommodations.  Although 
reasonable attempts will be made to accommodate students in off-campus learning environments, 
Grace College is unable to guarantee that every off-campus environment will be able to offer the 
accommodations that students request. In the cases in which there is a required off-campus experience, 
the DOGC will work with the Disability Office and the student to determine what accommodations are 
available for fulfilling the educational requirements.  
Readmission                                                                                                                                       
Individuals who want to be readmitted to the DOGC are defined as former students of DOGC who wish 
to reapply to the institution. The following is a list of readmission categories: 
• 
Following Voluntary Withdrawal - Students who have voluntarily withdrawn from the DOGC may 
apply for re-admission through the regular application process.  Students who have voluntarily 
withdrawn are not guaranteed readmission to the DOGC program. 
• 
Following Dismissal by SPDC - Students who have been dismissed from the program are eligible to 
reapply for admission after two years from the date of dismissal, through the regular application 
process. Students who have been issued a programmatic dismissal are not guaranteed readmission 
to the DOGC program. 
IMPORTANT: Students who are readmitted into the DOGC program may be required to retake certain 
classes depending on the length of time out of the program, changes in programmatic curriculum, and 
developments in the counseling field.  Decisions regarding readmission are made by the DOGC 
Admissions Committee and/or DOGC Chair on a case by case basis.  Students are notified in writing of 
the decision made regarding their readmission.  Readmitted students are subject to these decisions 
without appeal. 
Second Degree Completion

Students who would like to obtain a second master’s degree at Grace must complete a minimum of 50% 
of the second degree at Grace without any course substitutions in either the first or second master’s 
degree. Thus, no more than 50% of a given degree may count toward another degree. 
Transfer Credits Policy                                                                                                                          
Students accepted into the CMHC program may apply for transfer credit of a maximum of four (4) 
graduate level counseling courses (12 credit hours) from a CACREP accredited program to be applied 
towards the completion of their CMHC degree.  Only graduate counseling courses completed prior to 
admission into the DOGC program, and within the last five (5) years with a grade of “B” or higher, are 
eligible for transfer consideration.  Students applying for transfer credit must complete the Application 
for Course Transfer Credit Form and submit this form to the Department Chair.  Students will be 
required to submit official transcripts and course syllabi to determine the equitability of the course(s) 
previously taken with the current CMHC curriculum.  Clinical coursework (Practicum, Internship, and 
Advanced Internship) may not be satisfied through transfer credit.  Courses taken subsequent to 
admission to the CMHC program are not eligible for transfer.  All transfer credit paperwork must be 
submitted and approved before the end of the student’s first 8-week session at Grace 
College.  Decisions regarding course transfer are made by the Department of Graduate Counseling Chair 
on a case by case basis.  Students are notified in writing of the decision made regarding their transfer 
credits.  The Registrar’s Office will be notified of all transfer approvals by the DOGC.  
Degree Completion Policy                                                                                          
Students enrolled in the DOGC program are allowed seven (7) years from the beginning of their 
coursework to complete all degree requirements.  Students may be asked to repeat clinical courses 
(Counseling Skills, Practicum, Internship, or Advanced Internship) that were taken more than five years 
prior to completing the CMHC curriculum at the discretion of the Department Chair.   
Withdrawal Policy 
1. Course Withdrawal  
Students can add or drop courses during the allotted add/drop window each semester as 
determined by the Grace College Registrar’s Office.  Students who wish to drop a graduate course 
from their schedule of study outside of the allotted add/drop window must complete the Course 
Withdrawal form and submit this form to their academic advisor.   
IMPORTANT: Students who take a course Withdrawal are responsible for understanding the 
ramifications of such a decision on their financial aid, loan repayment plan, and expected graduation 
date. Please note that dates after which refunds are allowed and when an “F” is placed on the transcript 
rather than a “W” is determined by the Business and Registrar’s offices and students will need to work 
with these departments to ensure they have the needed information.  In the case of extenuating or 
unforeseen circumstances, such as a death in the family or serious health issue, students may petition 
the Department Chair, in writing, for a Late Withdrawal prior to the conclusion of the course, which if 
granted would allow the student to earn a “W” instead of a failing grade. Petitions are not always 
granted. Students who fail a course once may retake the course and if a passing grade is earned, the F 
will not appear on the transcript. It is highly recommended that students contact the Financial Aid 
office prior to withdrawal to discuss how these policies will impact them.

2. Continuous Enrollment 
Students accepted into the CMHC program are encouraged to maintain continuous enrollment. This 
means students remain active by completing a minimum of one course per semester. When a 
student chooses to take a break or temporarily withdraw from courses, Grace College and DOGC 
program policies are automatically initiated. For the purpose of financial aid and accounting, a 
student not enrolled in at least one course is viewed by Grace College to have withdrawn from the 
school. The student will be responsible for any financial accounts and may be placed in a payback 
status for Financial Aid. Students who temporarily withdraw from the program for a full academic 
year will be required to update their information with the Admissions Department and contact their 
advisor prior to returning to the program.  Students wishing to return to the CMHC program after a 
temporary withdrawal of more than one academic year must complete the application process and 
may be required to retake certain classes depending on the length of time out of the program, 
changes in programmatic curriculum, and developments in the counseling field.   
3. Temporary Withdrawal 
A student who considers not enrolling in classes should work with their advisor to discuss options 
and review consequences of a temporary withdrawal. If the student decides not to enroll in courses, 
they must submit a Temporary Withdrawal application to their advisor.  Courses taken outside the 
DOGC program during Temporary Withdrawal are not eligible for transfer credit. Students are 
required to attend Residency each year they are enrolled and actively taking classes within the 
CMHC program. Students who take a Temporary Withdrawal are strongly encouraged to attend 
scheduled Residencies in order to register for courses upon their return. 
IMPORTANT: Students who take a Temporary Withdrawal are responsible for understanding the 
ramifications of such a decision on their schedule of study and expected graduation date.  It is 
highly recommended that students work with their advisor prior to withdrawal to discuss how 
this will impact them. 
4. Voluntary Programmatic Withdrawal 
Students who wish to withdraw from the DOGC must complete a Programmatic Withdrawal 
application and submit this form to their academic advisor.  Students who have been granted a 
programmatic withdrawal must reapply for admission into the DOGC program as per the regular 
application process outlined here.     
IMPORTANT: Students who take a Programmatic Withdrawal are responsible for understanding 
the ramifications of such a decision on their Financial Aid and loan repayment plan.  It is highly 
recommended that students contact the Financial Aid Office prior to withdrawal to discuss how 
this will impact them. 
5. Programmatic Dismissal 
In circumstances when the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC) has determined 
that a student will be dismissed from the program, the dismissal will be immediate, and the student 
will not be permitted to return to currently enrolled courses or complete further coursework. When 
students are dismissed from clinical courses, the SPDC will work with the student and clinical 
supervisor to provide an ethical and professional transition of the student’s client caseload. When 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 22 
 June 2023 
 
students are dismissed from the program, an “F “or No Credit (NCR) will be recorded on their 
transcripts for all current courses.  SPDC will notify OIT to deactivate student’s access to Grace 
College email and other services.    
Students who have been dismissed from the program are eligible to reapply for admission to the 
CMHC program after two years from the date of dismissal, through the regular application process. 
Students who have been issued a programmatic dismissal are not guaranteed readmission to the 
program. 
IMPORTANT: Students who are dismissed from the program are responsible for understanding the 
ramifications of such a decision on their financial aid, loan repayment plan, and campus email 
access.  Please note: students are responsible for contacting the business office regarding any 
tuition refunds.   
Recording of Lectures                                                                                                                                   
No audio or video recordings of any class session may be made without securing prior permission from 
the professor. The professor may legitimately choose not to allow such recordings. When permission is 
granted, it is understood that the recording is to be used only by the student(s) registered in the course 
involved. No public use or reduplication is permitted. The recording of one class, or several classes, or 
portions of classes, when an excused absence is absolutely necessary, may be permitted, but such 
recordings should not be collected or preserved for other uses. When recording is helpful for a student 
attending the course to assist with certain disabilities, it is understood that the recordings are not to be 
collected or preserved for later use after the course. Some professors will not permit individual 
recording but may lend prepared recordings for use in case of emergency absences. These may not be 
duplicated. In no case may a student record, or have recorded, an entire course or a major portion of a 
course in lieu of attending classes or as a way to solve the problem of schedule conflicts without 
permission of the DOGC Department Chair. 
Graduation Policy                                                                                                                                    
Students must complete all degree requirements in accordance with the Academic Policies Manual, 
including the following:    
• 
Students applying for graduation with a graduate degree must have first received admission to that 
degree program. This acceptance occurs through the admissions office or the accepting program. 
• 
All students enrolled in a program must submit an application for graduation by the deadlines 
posted by the Registrar’s Office.  For more information regarding graduation, please click here.

Faculty Evaluation of Student Dispositions 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 23 
 June 2023 
 
Following each course, faculty review each student’s dispositions within that course, using standards 
outlined in the Counseling Program Retention Criteria. Student dispositions are rated on a 1 to 4 scale, 
with a rating of 3 indicating target performance. Instructors who score a student below a 3 in any 
category must have made previous formal contact with that student concerning this issue. In these 
situations, formal contact is expected to include a Notice of Concern, Professional Development 
Notification, an email outlining concerns, or a face-to-face meeting with the student documenting the 
instructor’s concern. Each year, every student receives a letter from the DOGC summarizing their 
performance in dispositional areas. 
Student Self-Evaluation of Dispositions 
Each year, all students in the DOGC program are required to complete the Student Self-Assessment of 
Professional Counseling Dispositions.  This quantitative and qualitative assessment is reviewed by the 
student’s advisor and each student is encouraged to discuss any concerns or questions with their 
academic advisor.  
Data is collected from the student self-assessments, both quantitative and qualitative, and themes are 
derived from responses. This collective data is reviewed by the DOGC faculty, and may be shared with 
the DOGC advisory board, for the purpose of evaluating and improving the program.   
Additional Graduation Application Criteria 
In addition, students enrolled in the DOGC program must abide by the following as it relates to 
graduation from the program:  
1. Students enrolled in the DOGC program must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 to be eligible for 
graduation. 
2. CMHC students must have registered for and passed Candidacy. 
3. CMHC students must register for and pass the Comprehensive Exam and Portfolio requirement of 
their program before they are eligible for graduation. Degrees will be conferred upon verification 
that (a) the Comprehensive Exam has been taken and passed and (b) the Portfolio requirements 
have been successfully met in addition to the other requirements of the program.   
4. CMHC students must be enrolled in Advanced Internship and be on-target to complete all required 
hours before they are eligible to apply for graduation.   
5. Any student intending to graduate from the DOGC within an academic year is required to 
complete an ""Application for Graduation"" and submit it to the Registrar's office within the time 
frame given.  The Registrar will forward a copy of the application to the DOGC.  
6. Graduation audits will be completed by the Registrar to verify students are in compliance with 
graduation degree requirements. 
7. Payment of all debts, encumbrances, fees, etc., must be cared for by the student in order to receive 
his or her diploma/degree. For loan borrowers, this may also include an online exit counseling 
requirement.  Specific information is available at the Financial Aid Office.

IMPORTANT:  Graduate students should consult their academic advisor for specific graduation 
information pertaining to their degree program. 
Critical Competencies for CMHC Students                                                                                    
Students enrolled in the CMHC program must demonstrate attainment of critical competencies related 
to theological, interpersonal, and clinical development as part of professional gatekeeping and satisfying 
the requirements for this degree.  In addition to passing academic and field courses, students must 
receive a passing score or “Credit” grade (as determined by the DOGC faculty) in each of the following 
competency assessment probes:       
1. Candidacy Requirements  
Candidacy is the gatekeeping process by which the DOGC faculty determines student readiness for 
advancement from didactic coursework into clinical work. Students must register for Candidacy 
following successful completion of the CPY 5700 Practicum course.  Candidacy is a “Pass/Fail” 
component of the CMHC degree.  Students passing Candidacy can proceed into the final clinical 
phase of the CMHC program (Internship and Advanced Internship). Students who do not pass 
Candidacy cannot proceed into Internship and will be referred to the Student Professional 
Development Committee (SPDC). Students who fail Candidacy may reapply for Candidacy once 
they have been given approval by the SPDC. Students who fail Candidacy twice will be 
dismissed from the CMHC program.  
A requirement of Candidacy is that each student must complete four counseling sessions with a 
licensed counselor. The personal counseling verification form must be submitted as part of 
Candidacy. In keeping with the program philosophy, personal counseling is required to process 
personal issues that often surface as a result of self-reflection, increased self-awareness, 
transference-countertransference, and working with clients whose presenting problems or 
personal characteristics trigger students’ own issues. The Department of Graduate Counseling 
can help provide the student with a referral list of counselors.  The student should be aware 
that this component might involve an additional expense. 
2. Comprehensive Exam  
The Comprehensive Exam is one of three gatekeeping processes (along with Candidacy and 
Portfolio) by which the DOGC faculty assesses student readiness to graduate from the CMHC 
program.  The Comprehensive Exam utilizes the standardized Counselor Preparation 
Comprehensive Examination (CPCE), administered by the National Board for Certified 
Counselors.  Students must make arrangements to take the CPCE through an approved testing 
site. Students should keep in mind the timing required for registration, completing the exam, 
and having scores sent to Grace College. CPCE scores must be received at least 30 days prior to 
the expected graduation date. Students will be required to pay for the test through the 
approved testing site. The Comprehensive Exam tests the student’s proficiency in the following 
eight major areas: Professional Counseling Orientation and Ethical Practice, Social and Cultural 
Diversity, Human Growth and Development; Career Development, Counseling and Helping 
Relationships; Social and Cultural Foundations; Group Counseling and Group Work; Assessment 
and Testing, and Research and Program Evaluation.  The CPCE is a “Pass/Fail” exam. The 
Department of Graduate Counseling, using the CPCE national norms, determines the minimum 
passing score. Students who earn the minimum passing score or higher are eligible to graduate 
from the CMHC program.  Students who score below the minimum passing score must re-take

the CPCE and receive a passing score in order to graduate.  If a student has not achieved a 
passing score after taking the CPCE three times but has shown competency in all areas covered 
by the exam, the student should meet with their advisor and the Department Chair to assess 
alternative methods of meeting the comprehensive exam requirement.  Please click here for 
more information on the CPCE. 
3. Portfolio 
Portfolio is one of three gatekeeping processes (along with the Comprehensive Exam) by which 
the DOGC faculty determines student readiness to graduate from the CMHC program.  Students 
must register to present their Portfolio prior to graduation during the Advanced Internship 
course. In addition to completing all Portfolio requirements, students must present a 
professional identity oral presentation Portfolio is a “Pass/Fail” component of the CMHC degree.  
Students receiving a passing grade will be eligible for graduation from the CMHC program.  
Students receiving a failing grade are not eligible for graduation.  Students who fail Portfolio will 
be required to complete remedial work as designated by faculty. If a student fails Portfolio twice 
but has shown competency in all areas of the Portfolio assessment otherwise, the student 
should meet with their advisor and the department chair to assess alternative methods of 
meeting the Portfolio requirement. Graduation will be postponed until Portfolio has been 
passed.

writing. 
The complete policy can be found in the Academic Policies Manual available on the Student's Right to 
Know page of the institution’s website.  
Citation and Format Style Policy                                                                                                                
The American Psychological Association (APA) citation and format style is commonly used within the 
social sciences when writing research papers. This citation and format style (from the most recent 
Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association) is the standard requirement for all 
students taking courses within the DOGC. 
Textbooks                                                                                                                                                        
A listing of the textbooks for each course offered may be found at the Grace College bookstore using 
this link. Students may also find this to be a convenient place to purchase the course texts and materials, 
although students are not required to purchase books from any specific vendor. In addition, the book list 
is available on the DOGC Portal Resources page.  
Endorsement Policy                                                                                                                                
Students enrolled in, graduating from, or alumni of a DOGC program may request letters of 
recommendation from DOGC faculty related to employment and licensure.  The DOGC faculty reserves 
the right to determine whether or not a letter of recommendation will be issued to a student. Letters of 
recommendation are a privilege/courtesy and should be viewed this way. The DOGC faculty is under no

obligation to endorse a student or write letters of recommendation. 
Professional Organizations                                                                                                                 
The DOGC acknowledges the importance of counseling students development of a professional 
counseling identity through membership and participation in professional counseling organizations. To 
facilitate this process, all students are required to join a professional counseling organization by the end 
of the first year of their schedule of study. Students may enroll in national counseling organizations such 
as the American Counseling Association (ACA) or the American Mental Health Counseling Association 
(AMHCA), or students may elect membership in their state or other regional professional counseling 
organization. Students are required to participate in their chosen professional counseling organization 
for a minimum of three (3) hours per year. This participation may include attending or presenting at 
conferences, serving on student committees, volunteering, or other professional involvement. Students 
must submit evidence of their membership and participation in a professional counseling organization 
to their advisors each year in order to be eligible to register for courses.   
License  
Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) or Licensed Professional Counselor 
(LPC)                                                                                                                   
Persons interested in licensing should check with the state licensing board for the state in which 
licensing will be pursued. In Indiana, this license requires a 60-hour master’s degree in counseling from 
an accredited college or university. In addition, the candidate must complete a designated number of 
supervised counseling hours under a licensed counselor or psychologist and pass a qualifying 
examination. For more information about Indiana licensure, please consult the Indiana Professional 
Licensing Agency website.  
All states accept the education of applicants for licensure from a CACREP-approved program. However, a 
few states require additional coursework. The DOGC webpage maintains information on state 
requirements for licensure. It is important that students check the licensing boards/agencies of their 
state for detailed requirements.  If a student becomes a licensed mental health counselor, continuing 
education credit hours are necessary on a yearly basis to maintain licensure.

• 
Financial Aid Policies 
Students interested in further information about the financial aid application process, financial aid 
award notices, financial aid eligibility and appeals, satisfactory academic progress, and financial aid 
suspension should contact the Office of Student Financial Aid Services. 
• 
Refunds  
Tuition refunds for students withdrawing or dropping a class will be based on the official date of 
that action.  A student withdrawing from the school must contact the DOGC to complete the 
appropriate forms.  A student dropping from a class must contact the DOGC to complete the drop.   
Withdrawal from the school or dropping a class can change financial aid.  It is the student’s 
responsibility to contact the Financial Aid office and the Business Office to ascertain the effect of 
the action and make payment if needed. 
Satisfactory Academic Progress                                                                                                     
Recipients of student financial assistance are required to make satisfactory academic progress toward 
a specific educational objective or degree. The federal government's Department of Education has 
mandated that Grace College monitor and enforce these standards which are consistent with the 
educational mission of the college. This policy applies to all students receiving assistance from any 
financial aid program administered by the Office of Financial Aid at Grace College.  This policy is 
administered separately from the college's academic probation and suspension policy.  
Qualitative and Quantitative Measure 
Satisfactory academic progress is measured by both a qualitative and a quantitative standard.  The 
qualitative standard is based on meeting the minimum cumulative GPA required for the number of 
hours attempted.  The quantitative standard requires the student to have completed the required 
minimum percentage for the number of hours attempted.  The Office of Financial Aid determines on an 
annual basis (at the end of spring semester) the eligibility of the student for continued financial aid 
based on the standards established under the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy.   
GRADUATE LEVEL: 
Hours 
Attempted 
Minimum % 
Of Completion 
Minimum 
Cum. GPA 
All (1+) 
67% 
2.000 
Students who fail to complete the required minimum percentage of credit hours as listed above and/or 
who do not meet the minimum grade point requirements during any applicable academic year will be 
cited as not making satisfactory academic progress.  Students who fail to meet the standards at the end 
of the spring semester each academic year will be placed on financial aid suspension and notified in 
writing.  Students placed on suspension are not eligible for financial aid funding. 
Courses for which a student receives F, W, or I will count as credits attempted but will not be considered 
as credits successfully completed.  Incompletes will be considered as successful completions if the I is 
changed to a grade (other than F or W) within the six-week period granted by the Academic Policy 
Manual.  Courses that are repeated for academic forgiveness will count in the number of credits 
attempted and completed.  If the original course had a passing grade, the original credits are counted as

completed even though the grade is no longer calculated as part of the cumulative GPA.  Courses for 
which a student receives CR count towards credits attempted and completed even if the grade is not 
calculated as part of the cumulative GPA.  Courses for which a student receives NCR count toward the 
credits attempted but not completed. Courses which are taken for credit, even though they are remedial 
in nature, are counted in both the quantitative and qualitative computations for eligibility. AU (Audit) 
credits do not count either in the cumulative GPA or in the credit hours attempted/completed.  
Eligibility and Appeal Process 
A student who has lost eligibility for financial aid may take courses at Grace College at their own 
expense until they have achieved the required minimum cumulative GPA and/or the required minimum 
number of credit hours.  Once completing these requirements, the student must request that SAP be 
reviewed again if requirements are completed at the end of Fall or Summer terms. Financial aid will be 
reinstated if the student has been found to be meeting the SAP requirements. 
A student who has been denied financial aid can appeal by contacting the Registrar to develop an 
Academic Plan that will enable the student to regain SAP by the end of a year. A student has 30 days 
from the date of the notification of suspension to develop the Academic Plan and submit it to the Office 
of Financial Aid.  The Academic Plan needs to spell out when and how SAP will be achieved. The 
Academic Plan will grant one year of SAP Probation. If the student is not meeting this prescribed plan 
when SAP is reviewed again at the end of the spring term, the student will be placed on Financial Aid 
Suspension until SAP has been achieved and there will not be another probationary period. 
If a student cannot develop a satisfactory academic plan with the registrar that will resolve their SAP 
failure by the end of a year, the student will have to pay for courses at their own expense. 
Student Rights and Responsibilities                                                                                                          
All students enrolled in the DOGC program assume an obligation to conduct themselves at all times as 
responsible members of the Grace College community, to respect the personal and property rights of 
others, and to support the educational mission of Grace College.  Grace College and the DOGC insist that 
its students demonstrate personal and professional integrity in addition to academic excellence. Grace 
College administrators, faculty, and staff encourage student involvement in decision making. Student 
membership and input on institutional committees are valued and encouraged at Grace College. 
Attitude and Conduct Expectations                                                                                                  
Members of the Grace College community are committed to the mission of the institution and to living 
in a manner that brings glory to the name of our Lord. All students enrolled in the DOGC program are 
required to uphold the standards of the Grace College community and affirm their agreement to do so 
by signing a Statement on Community Lifestyle Expectations. A copy of this document can be found on 
the Department of Graduate Counseling Resource page on the portal.   
In addition to following the Grace College community lifestyle expectations, students also are required 
to adhere to the Code of Conduct Policy outlined below:  
Code of Conduct Policy                                                                                     
All students enrolled in the DOGC program are expected to conduct themselves in an ethical, 
professional, and civil manner.  Students found guilty of the following violations shall be subject to 
disciplinary action up to and including dismissal from Grace College:

pertaining to the counseling profession. 
 
If a professor believes that a student is violating any of the above guidelines, the offending parties will 
be contacted directly in an effort to discuss the situation. Based on the severity of the violation and/or 
the student’s receptivity to the instructor’s intervention, the professor reserves the right to implement 
remediation of issues related to the offense.  Offenses that violate policies and procedures outlined in 
the Graduate Counseling program catalog or the professional ethics and standards published by the 
American Counseling Association may result in a failing grade or a “No Credit” for the course.  
If a student feels that another student is behaving inappropriately, they are advised to follow the 
principles outlined in Matthew 18 and discuss this concern with the other student. If for some reason, 
the student does not feel they can do this, the student is advised to send a private email to the 
professor explaining the situation to discuss a wise course of action as soon as possible. 
The DOGC reserves the right to discipline or dismiss a student who, in its judgment, does not conform 
either to the stated regulations governing conduct or to the expressed principles, policies, and programs 
of Grace College.  By virtue of their enrollment in the DOGC program, students agree to live within the 
framework of these standards.  Students suspected of violating either the institutional or programmatic 
Code of Conduct will be referred to the SPDC. Students found guilty of violating either Code of Conduct 
are subject to sanctions up to and including dismissal from Grace College. Disciplinary problems will be 
handled by the Dean of the School of Behavioral Sciences and the Chair of the DOGC in conjunction with 
the Vice President of Student Affairs and Academic Services. Students found guilty of violating the Code 
of Conduct Policy, even a first offense, shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including 
dismissal from Grace College.

Student Concerns Regarding the Faculty Instructor                                                                                                           
If the student has concerns or conflict with the faculty instructor, they should first approach the 
professor and attempt to resolve the stated concerns in a one-on-one meeting. If the student feels that 
the concerns are not addressed or resolved after meeting with the instructor, the student should 
contact their advisor to discuss further recourse options.  If the student’s concerns are regarding a 
perceived ethical or moral violation on the part of the faculty instructor and the student does not feel 
comfortable discussing this with the professor, the student is advised to discuss this with the 
Department of Graduate Counseling Chair. 
Requesting Additional Evaluation by Professionals                                                                                                 
Referral for mandatory evaluation is the purview of the Dean of Behavioral Sciences. The Dean may 
require a student to submit to an evaluation by a health care professional in limited circumstances (such 
as where violence or suicide is threatened and where drug or alcohol abuse is suspected). In such cases, 
the evaluation is to determine and protect the health and safety of the student, the campus, and/or 
clinical site during practicum and internship courses.   
Academic Dishonesty/Plagiarism 
Academic Integrity                                                                                                                                         
Grace College and Seminary is committed to fostering students’ intellectual, moral, and spiritual 
development.  Academic dishonesty—in all forms—is a serious violation of academic integrity, Grace’s 
community standards for scholarship and behavior, and Christian morality.  Because academic integrity 
is an important value of Grace College and Seminary, violations of the Academic Integrity Policy may 
result in severe academic penalties and/or disciplinary consequences. 
• 
Students are expected to uphold high standards of academic integrity and refrain from committing 
or facilitating acts of academic dishonesty.  Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, 
cheating, plagiarizing, falsifying or fabricating data, stealing or interfering with another student’s 
work, and submitting substantial portions of the same work for more than one course without prior 
consent from the instructor. 
• 
All submitted work is accepted as a student’s own work, unless otherwise understood and 
approved by the instructor. 
• 
A student may not submit for one course substantial portions of work that have been used to fulfill

A student must not intentionally or knowingly help another student to commit an act of academic 
dishonesty. 
• 
Faculty communicate additional expectations and clarifications about discipline-specific practices, 
particular assignments, and collaborative work via syllabi and in-class instructions. 
• 
No one responsible for teaching or assisting in a course, including instructors and teaching 
assistants, will tolerate academic dishonesty.  Infractions of the Academic Integrity Policy will be 
reported by the faculty of record to the academic program administrator, and the Academic Affairs 
Office. The Academic Affairs Office will then notify the Student Affairs Office and Registrar’s Office 
as necessary. 
• 
Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy will result in proportional consequences, which include 
but are not limited to, failure of the assignment, course grade reduction, and failure of the course, 
as stated in the course syllabus. In assigning a consequence, the faculty member (in consultation

with the Academic Affairs Office) will consider the type and extent of academic dishonesty involved, 
as well as whether the student has a record of prior offenses.  Mitigating factors, such as the 
student’s cooperation and contrition, may also be considered. 
• 
Additional consequences may be imposed by Grace College and Seminary and might include 
ineligibility for certain student jobs or leadership positions (such as teaching assistantships), 
suspension from campus or the academic program(s), and/or a hearing before a discipline panel.

Plagiarism                                                                                                                                                  
Plagiarism is defined as presenting someone else’s ideas, language, or work as one’s own without 
properly citing or acknowledging the source. Any ideas or materials taken from another source, whether 
copyrighted or not, must be properly documented unless that information is common knowledge. 
“Common knowledge” refers to information or facts that are widely known within a discipline or a 
course and therefore not attributable to one source.  Examples of plagiarism include failing to cite 
content that originates from the work of another, failing to use quotation marks to identify direct 
quotes, and copying and pasting from any source on any assignment, exam, quiz, PowerPoint slide, 
discussion board or course requirement without identifying the author or reference.  
All of the following are considered plagiarism: 
• 
Turning in someone else's work as your own 
• 
Copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit 
• 
Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks 
• 
Giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation 
• 
Changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit 
• 
Copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether 
you give credit or not (see our section on ""fair use"" rules)

Self-Plagiarism 
Just as students are not allowed to present the ideas or work of others without properly giving the 
author credit, they also do not present their own previously submitted work as new scholarship. 
Students may not use direct quotes, paraphrases, or materials from their own work that were previously 
submitted in other courses (for Grace College or any other educational institution) or within a course 
without first obtaining permission from the course instructor. If a student is given permission by the 
course instructor to use previously submitted work, they must cite their work according to APA 
guidelines.  All of the following are considered self-plagiarism: 
• 
Submitting a paper written for a previous course 
• 
Multiple submissions of the same paper to meet different assignments 
• 
Journal entries copied or pasted as discussion board posts 
• 
PowerPoint slides recycled from a previous presentation

Academic Appeal and Review Process 
A. Students have the right to appeal academic decisions in which they believe they have been treated 
unjustly or have been unfairly criticized, and to express grievances related to academic situations. These 
decisions and situations typically include, but are not limited to, those related to grades and grading 
procedures, assessment of student learning (e.g., tests and assignments), classroom policies, instructional or 
classroom management strategies, and advising decisions. Those involved in the dispute (e.g., the student 
and the professor, advisor, internship supervisor or other) are encouraged to use professional discretion, 
integrity, respect, and impartial judgment in resolving issues amongst themselves.  
Students are asked to use the following process for appeals: 
1. Within 10 business days of the situation prompting the student’s concern, the student should 
express his or her concerns via email, a letter, or a phone call, or in a face-to-face conversation 
within a virtual meeting room, to the person responsible for the decision or involved in the dispute 
so that the student can communicate his/her concerns and attempt to resolve the issue between 
the individuals involved. The faculty member or instructor should arrange to meet with the student 
within 10 business days of the student’s request.  
2. If the student remains unsatisfied with the outcome of the decision by the faculty 
member/instructor, the student should put the issue in writing and submit it to the chair of the 
department with 10 business days following the decision reached after completing Step #1. The 
student may include any supporting documentation needed. The written dispute should include 
the facts and concerns about the case and specify the student’s desired outcome. The 
Department Chair will review the concern and respond within 10 business days. In the case 
where the Department Chair is the faculty assigning the grade to be appealed, the student will 
submit the written request to appeal the grade to an appropriately convened, Faculty Appeals 
Committee (FAC).  
3. If the student remains unsatisfied with the outcome of the decision by the Department Chair, the 
student may request that the Department Chair convene a Faculty Appeals Committee (FAC) for 
review of the concern. The FAC will include three (3) faculty members who will review the 
student’s concerns and all supporting documentation from the student and professor and will 
provide a response to the student within 10 business days of being convened. In academic 
appeals in which a student believes that his/her documented disability has affected his/her 
academic performance in the graduate program, the student will have the right to consult with the 
Disability Advisory Team (DAT), which will review the student's concern. In such cases, the FAC will 
give due weight to the DAT's recommendations or other reasonable measures will be taken to 
address the concern. 
Academic Professional Retention Policy                                                                                         
Students must uphold program and college standards, professional counseling standards, and the ACA 
and AACC Codes of Ethics to be retained in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program. These 
essential skills, knowledge, and values may be considered both academic and professional in nature

Retention Procedure 
Faculty members are to discuss concerns about academic, professional, or interpersonal competence 
directly with students. Following these discussions, faculty complete a Notice of Concern, or for more 
serious issues the DOGC Professional Development Notification (PDN) form, which is a written summary 
of the competence issue(s), an action plan for remediation, and a date for completion of the plan.  The 
plan is monitored by the student’s academic advisor as outlined in the DOGC Catalog section, Academic 
Advising.  Students failing to make substantial changes toward or comply with the objectives agreed 
upon in the PDN will be referred to the SPDC.  Copies of the PDN form are sent to the student, the 
student’s advisor, the department chair and are placed in the student’s file.  A student who receives two 
(2) PDN forms will be referred to the SPDC.  In the case of gross misconduct or behavior posing a risk to 
others, the student will be referred immediately to the SPDC. In the case of suspected criminal activity, 
the student will be referred immediately to the Department of Student Affairs who will consult with the 
Dean and Department Chair to determine appropriate action. Students who believe they have been 
treated unfairly must follow the Appeals Policy as outlined in the DOGC Catalog.  The Dean of the School 
of Behavioral Science maintains final authority regarding a student’s retention in the program. 
Student Professional Development Committee Policies and Procedures 
Student Professional Development Committee                                                                                    
The Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC) is an academic committee responsible for 
monitoring the academic progress, professional competence and behavior of students enrolled in The 
DOGC program. Students who do not meet the academic standards of their program or whose behaviors 
raise concerns about professional competence will be referred to the SPDC. The primary purpose of the 
SPDC is to review submitted information related to concerns about students’ professional development 
and/or competence to determine appropriate steps for remediation or dismissal from the program.  
Committee Membership                                                                                                                                                           
The SPDC consists of at least three (3) voting members to be comprised of School of Behavioral Science 
faculty and one recording secretary. Where three voting members from a single department are not 
available, membership may be interdepartmental. Faculty members are selected by the DOGC Chair or 
Dean of the School of Behavioral Science.  
Referral Procedure   
Any member of the academic community who wishes to bring a student concern before the SPDC must 
submit a formal letter of referral addressed to the Department Chair.  The letter should include specific 
descriptions of academic insufficiencies and subsequent attempts at remediation by faculty, and/or 
descriptions of behaviors that raise concerns about clinical competence and/or professional conduct. If a 
student is already under SPDC review and earns a failing grade, Notice of Concern, or Professional 
Development Notification (PDN), this information will be forwarded to the SPDC for consideration.   
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 39 
 June 2023 
 
If a student serving at an internship, practicum, or clinical placement is dismissed by the site, asked 
not to return, or fails a site supervisor evaluation, the student’s faculty supervisor will request the 
SPDC to convene for investigation of the circumstances. The focus of the investigation will be to 
determine what happened and appropriate steps for remediation or dismissal from the program.  
Once a referral is received, the committee is convened and follows established procedures.   
Committee Procedures  
The following procedures govern the actions of the SPDC: 
• 
The student should be notified in writing of the requirement to meet with the committee, the 
date and time of the meeting, and the reasons for the referral. The meeting should be held 
within 30 days of the date of receipt of the referral.  
• 
The committee will be convened in a suitable electronic environment.  
• 
In advance of the meeting, the committee may request additional information or 
documentation pertinent to the referral. Where third party witnesses are available, the 
committee may consider meeting with the witnesses in advance.  
• 
The student may submit written information relevant to the situation to the committee chair up 
to 48 hours prior to the meeting.  All written documentation should be made available for 
review by the student, the faculty, and the committee in advance of the meeting.  In cases when 
the situation warrants an immediate convening of the SPDC, the 48 hours for review of 
documentation is waived and the student may present relevant documentation to the 
committee at any time prior to or during the meeting.   
• 
If a student is notified of the meeting and does not attend, the SPDC may continue its action and 
render a decision.  
• 
The student is permitted to have a support person from the academic community present for a 
committee meeting, including another student, faculty or DOGC staff member from Grace 
College.  Support persons may not be family members of the student.  
• 
The support person attending the committee meeting is expected to be visible on the screen, 
but is not permitted to speak during the meeting and must not act as an attorney or an 
advocate because students are expected to speak on their own behalf. Support persons are not 
permitted to speak to or coach the student during the meeting. 
• 
The student is not permitted to bring legal counsel to committee meetings. 
• 
Verbatim transcription or electronic recording of the meeting is not permitted.  The recording 
secretary will transcribe minutes of the meeting and subsequent decisions.   
• 
The committee should ensure that the student has been apprised of the concerns and has had 
an opportunity to respond.  
• 
Within ten (10) business days of the meeting the committee members shall render a decision on 
what course of action is required. The outcomes may include, but are not limited to the following: 
o Referral to advisor, Clinical Coordinator, or DOGC faculty member for remediation using 
a specific plan created by the SPDC committee including identified academic and/or 
behavioral outcomes, consequences, and process for monitoring.   
o Referral to outside resources 
o Probation with explicit requirements and a timeline for removal from probation. The 
committee should include any consequences for noncompliance with probation 
requirements  
o Program dismissal  
• 
The committee should also consider whether the program or student should take any follow up 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 40 
 June 2023 
 
action with an internship or practicum site, with an instructor, or with another student in order to 
preserve or reconcile a professional relationship.   
• 
The committee chair shall inform the student and appropriate faculty of its decision and any 
remediation requirements in writing within ten (10) business days of the committee’s decision.  In 
all cases, the faculty should describe the problems resulting in referral and the recommended 
solutions in specific detail. 
 
Monitoring Progress                                                                                                                                                                  
The SPDC Committee uses the following procedures for monitoring the progress of students referred to 
SPDC for concerns about academic and/or behavioral competencies. 
A. When a student has been placed on probation, the SPDC will develop and provide to the 
student the explicit requirements that must be completed, a date for reporting completion to 
the committee, and the consequences for failing to reach the desired goals.  The student will 
communicate with the Committee Chair for questions related to the requirements and will 
submit all documentation of compliance to the chair by the established date. Within ten (10) 
business days of receipt of the student’s documentation, the Committee Chair will either notify 
the student in writing that the documentation or actions taken by the student do not meet the 
agreed upon criteria or will issue a letter stating that the competency has been resolved and no 
further action by the SPDC is needed at this time. It is noted that resolving a competency does 
not preclude the student from being referred to the committee at another time for further 
concerns about the same or other competencies. If the documentation is not submitted by the 
required date or the actions taken by the student do not meet the criteria specified by the 
SPDC, the committee will reconvene to determine the next course of action, which can include 
dismissal from the program.  
 
B. When a student has been referred to outside resources, the student will be provided with a 
date for providing a progress report to the SPDC on the outcomes of the referrals. The progress 
report should be in the form of a letter from the outside source(s) that provides an update of 
the student’s progression in the competency that was cited as a concern by the SPDC. While 
the SPDC does not require the student to waive confidentiality, the student will be required to 
sign a limited waiver of confidentiality with the outside source, allowing the Committee Chair 
to ascertain that the student and the outside referral source are remediating the identified 
competence and that the student is making progress. It is noted that resolving a competency 
does not preclude the student from being referred to the committee at another time for 
further concerns about the same or other competencies. While the student is working with an 
outside referral source, should the student demonstrate ongoing concerns regarding the 
identified or other competencies before that time, the SPDC will reconvene to determine the 
next course of action, including remediation, probation, or dismissal from the program.  
C. When the SPDC determines that a student will be dismissed from the program, the dismissal is 
immediate and will follow the policy outlined in the DOGC Catalog under Program Dismissal.  
D. If a student is already under SPDC review and earns a failing grade or Professional Development 
Notification (PDN), the SPDC will convene to consider whether current remediation should be 
continued, revised, or if the student should be dismissed.   
The committee should also consider whether the program or student should take any follow up action 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 41 
 June 2023 
 
with an internship or practicum site, with an instructor, or with another student in order to preserve or 
reconcile a professional relationship.   
The committee chair shall inform the student and appropriate faculty of its decision and any 
remediation requirements in writing within 10 business days of the committee’s decision. In all cases, 
the faculty should describe the problems before it and the recommended solutions in specific detail.   
Students with Disabilities Appearing Before SPDC 
When a student has a documented disability, the SPDC works with the Grace College Disability 
Services Coordinator to ensure required accommodations for committee proceedings are provided. 
All students with or without a documented disability must perform to the standards of conduct and 
academic achievement required by Grace College and the DOGC CMHC program. Accommodations 
are not retroactive and the failure to request accommodations does not forgive past 
difficulties.  Referral for mandatory evaluation is the purview of the dean of the School of Behavioral 
Science.   
Appeal Process  
If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the SPDC committee, the student may submit a 
written appeal of the decision to the Dean of the School of Behavioral Science within ten (10) 
business days of receiving the written documentation from the SPDC. Within ten (10) business days 
of the receipt of the appeal, an Appeals committee comprised of the Dean and two faculty members 
from the college community outside of the DOGC will convene to consider and render a decision 
regarding the student’s appeal. Any results of the SPDC proceedings will remain in place until the 
Appeals committee renders a decision otherwise. The student must obey the terms of the SPDC 
decision pending the outcome of the appeal.  
Counseling Skills and Practicum  
 
Counseling Skills                                                                                                                                
Counseling Skills is a crucial learning component of the DOGC. One aspect of this course involves 
addressing the student’s personal life issues (problems, background, relational style, etc.) which may 
impede or enhance therapeutic work with clients. Issues that could be detrimental to counseling will be 
addressed because of the commitment to the well-being of clients and a desire to avoid sending out 
graduates who could do harm to their clients. The process may be disruptive at times; however, we 
believe it is necessary for the well-being of clients. Our goal in this process is to help the students grow 
in Christ and become the most effective counselor possible.  
Another aspect of this course involves the acquisition of counseling skills while continuing to look at 
personal life issues that impede therapeutic work with clients. The various skills of counseling will be 
taught via methods such as classroom instruction, role-play, and videos. Students will practice skills in 
class, within triadic groups comprised of Counseling Skills class members, or with volunteers. Students 
will provide tapes of practice sessions and faculty evaluate students to determine if they are prepared to 
advance to Practicum.  
Practicum                                                                                                                                                         
After the successful completion of the Counseling Skills course the student is eligible for Practicum.  
Students must have completed or are simultaneously taking the following: Counseling Skills (CPY5350), 
Foundations of CMHC (CPY5100), Group Counseling (CPY6350), Psychopathology (CPY5250) and 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025

Theories of Personality and Counseling (CPY5200). The Practicum experience is designed to provide the 
student with actual counseling experience, along with group and individual supervision. Practicum must 
be completed at approved clinical sites within the United States or recognized U.S. military installation.   
Students will not be allowed to take more than 36 hours before taking practicum, unless 
they have been given a specific waiver to do so.  
 
Practicum is a 16-week course in which the student will accumulate 100 clinical hours in the following 
manner:  
Direct service with clients with at least 10 in group work 
40 
Individual supervision (with appropriately licensed faculty or site 
supervisors (e.g. LMHC, LMFT, LCSW) 
15  
Group supervision facilitated by a faculty member 
24 
Other indirect clinical hours (research, note writing, site training, etc.) 
21  
             Total 
100 hrs. 
 
 
Counseling Skills and Practicum Credit/No Credit Policy                                                                
One way in which students are “screened” for interpersonal attributes and behaviors that may do harm 
to clients is through the Counseling Skills and Practicum classes. This is the reason a “Credit/No Credit” 
(“CR”-”NC”) system is used for these courses. If a student receives “Credit” (“CR”), then the student may 
proceed to the next clinical course.  If a student receives “No Credit” (“NC”), then he or she is required 
to repeat the failed course before advancing to the next.  Prior to or after receiving a NC, a referral may 
be made to the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC).   
A student may receive “NC” for one (or more) of the following reasons: 
1. More than one (1) absence during scheduled Faculty Group Supervision in Practicum (CPY 5700 I). 
2. Inadequate, incomplete, or unacceptable Case Study presentations (as determined by the 
Instructor/Faculty Supervisor).  
3. Disciplinary actions that are the result of unprofessional/unethical conduct either at the 
Practicum/Internship site or in the classroom and/or failure to comply with directions and 
consultation given by either the Faculty Supervisor or any Site Supervisor. All disciplinary problems 
will be documented in the student’s file. 
4. If the Faculty Supervisor determines that the student’s current emotional, mental or physical well-
being compromises the integrity of the Practicum/Internship experience or potentially places the 
student or others in harm’s way or in an unduly vulnerable position. All such cases will be brought to 
the attention of the Clinical Coordinator and the Program Chair. 
5. If there is a question or concern of competency in areas such as (but not limited to): 
a. Interpersonal and professional competence (e.g., the ways in which a student relates to clients, 
peers, faculty, allied professionals, the public, and individuals from diverse backgrounds or 
histories) 
b. Self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-evaluation (e.g., knowledge of the content and potential 
impact of one's own beliefs and values on clients, peers, faculty, allied professionals, the public, 
and individuals from diverse backgrounds or histories) 
c. Openness to processes of supervision (e.g., the ability and willingness to explore issues that 
either interfere with the appropriate provision of care or impede professional development or

functioning) 
d. Resolution of problems or issues that interfere with professional development or functioning in 
a satisfactory manner (e.g., by responding constructively to feedback from supervisors or 
program faculty; by participating in personal therapy in order to resolve problems or issues) 
 
If the student receives “No Credit” (“NC”) or indicators of below expectations on the Practicum Site 
Supervisor Evaluation Form, the DOGC faculty may require work outside of the program in order to 
address the issue(s) involved. This may include but is not limited to extra course work, counseling, and 
accountability. It is the responsibility of the student to pay for the costs that may be incurred due to 
required remedial work.  
If one of the above listed problem areas is discovered, there are two steps to the remediation process: 
1. The student is provided with a written copy of the Practicum Evaluation Form and meets with 
the professor to discuss problematic areas.     
2. If a student receives one or more Professional Characteristic indicators at below expectations 
on the Practicum Evaluation Form, the student will be required to meet with the professor to 
discuss remediation.  A copy of the evaluation scale and any action taken will be given to the 
student and placed in the student’s file. 
If, at the final evaluation, the student has not satisfactorily and successfully completed the remedial 
work in its entirety and/or receives one or more professional characteristic indicators of a “1” (below 
expectations) on the Practicum Evaluation form, the student will earn a “No Credit” (“NC”) and a 
Professional Development Notification will be issued.     
In addition, prior to or after receiving an NC, a referral may be made to the Student Professional 
Development Committee (SPDC).  In order to repeat the course, additional remedial work may be 
required. The student may repeat that particular class only one time. Receiving “NC” twice for a 
particular class will result in dismissal from the program. If the student is informed that he or she will 
be dismissed from the program, the instructor will meet with the student to discuss alternative 
educational/ employment options. A referral will also be made to the director of Career Services. 
Please Note: The decision to give “NC” to a student will be made by the class professor. If the student 
wishes to challenge this decision, the student must follow the academic appeal and review process. Also 
note: At any point during the remediation process, a student may be referred to the SPDC.  
Subjective Component of Credit/No Credit Grading                                                                             
In the final analysis, all grading is subjective. It is highly dependent upon the observations, experience, 
and professional and academic judgments of the DOGC faculty. The decision to award “Credit” or “No 
Credit” is based upon how students respond to and achieve what the professor has determined should 
be achieved in role-plays, tapes, paperwork, critiques, group discussion feedback, case scenario 
presentations, completion of readings, etc.  
The award of “Credit/No Credit” is also developed within a comparative analysis with other students. 
The reality is that not all students in Counseling Skills/Practicum work are at the same levels. Not all 
have the same goals, clinical skills, cognitive capabilities, level of interest, work ethic, experiential 
background, or maturity. Therefore, not all students may receive “Credit” for the course.

When students have agency supervisors along with a supervisor for Practicum, the Practicum supervisor 
is considered the primary supervisor and the agency supervisor is considered the secondary supervisor. 
The primary supervisor will make the final decision as to whether a student will receive “Credit” or “No 
Credit” for the class. The feedback from the agency supervisor will be requested and incorporated into 
the final decision; however, the final decision remains with the Counseling Skills/Practicum Faculty 
Supervisor.  
Site Supervisor Concerns Regarding Practicum Students                                                                      
If the agency supervisor perceives that the student is not meeting minimal standards of competency at 
the Practicum site, the agency supervisor will identify challenges and possible solutions the student will 
need to meet. If the agency supervisor believes additional work is necessary for the student, a written 
remedial plan will be developed by mid semester. The remedial plan will need to be completed 
satisfactorily and in its entirety by the end of the semester. A copy of this remedial plan will be given to 
the student and the Practicum, Internship, and Advanced Internship supervisor.  
If a remedial plan cannot be agreed upon between the agency supervisor and the student, the Practicum 
faculty supervisor will be notified. The Practicum faculty supervisor will meet with the student and the 
agency supervisor and make a reasonable attempt to help all parties reach a satisfactory agreement. 
The Practicum faculty supervisor reserves the right to make a site visit and to observe the student’s 
practice within the agency.  
Up to the three-quarter point in the semester, a student has the opportunity to obtain a new agency 
supervisor at the present site if a new agency supervisor is available. If an alternative agency supervisor 
is not available at that site, the student will need to obtain an alternative site and alternative agency 
supervisor. The student will need to discuss these plans with the Practicum faculty supervisor. If the 
student decides to obtain an alternative supervisor, the remedial work still needs to be completed to 
the full satisfaction of the Practicum faculty supervisor. 
Please note: At any point during the process in which an agency supervisor perceives that a student is not 
meeting minimal standards, a student may be subject to referral to the SPDC. 
Guidelines for Counseling Internships 
Internship and Advanced Internship 
Two (2) internships are required for the 60-hour M.A. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling degree: 
1.  Internship in Clinical Mental Health Counseling: Internship is to be completed in a clinical mental 
health facility under the supervision of a fully licensed clinical supervisor (e.g., LMHC, LCSW, 
LMFT). See course syllabus for details. Students are responsible for knowing and meeting the 
number of hours required for licensure in their current state of residence.    
2.  Advanced Internship in Clinical Mental Health Counseling: Advanced Internship is to be 
completed in a clinical mental health facility. Students are responsible for knowing and meeting 
the number of hours required for licensure in their current state of residence.    
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 45 
 June 2023 
 
3.    Supervision evaluations will be used as a major determinant for the student to receive a “CR” or 
“NC” for each respective course. If a student receives an “NC” for a course, that course may be 
repeated one (1) time only. A second “NC” will result in termination from the program.  
IMPORTANT: Internships are clinical courses required to develop and refine advanced counseling skills 
that conceptually link counseling theory and practice in a clinical setting.  All Internship courses must 
be completed at approved clinical sites and have a fully licensed clinical supervisor (e.g. LMHC, LCSW, 
LMFT) on site.   
Paid Internship Policy                                                                                                                                 
Many internship sites offer non-paid positions. However, the DOGC M.A. in Clinical Mental Health 
Counseling degree will allow paid positions to be used for internship credits as long as certain 
requirements are met. The site must meet the criteria established by the DOGC. The student must 
obtain approval from the site supervisor and class instructor before the internship begins. The student 
must discuss the clinical experiences he or she expects to pursue in the paid position with the internship 
supervisor to ensure the student gains a variety of clinical experiences. If the student is employed with 
the internship-issuing agency before enrolling in internship, the internship experience must be beyond 
the scope of their current job description. The student must also complete and submit a Work 
Internship Agreement to the Clinical Coordinator for approval prior to signing an Agency Agreement 
with the site.  
Intern Performance Evaluation/Criteria and Procedures: 
1. Internship Credit/No-Credit Policy 
Counseling involves extensive personal investment. Consequently, Interns will be learning more 
than knowledge and acquiring skills. Internship is challenging both academically and emotionally 
and Interns will likely be affected in the development of learning clinical skills. Intern 
participation in this clinical experience will not always be a comfortable experience.  We utilize a 
Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) system as a method of preventing Interns who may cause more harm 
than good to clients from progressing in the clinical components of the program. If an Intern 
receives CR, then the Intern may proceed to Advanced Internship. If an Intern receives NC, then 
the Intern is issued a Professional Development Notification and must repeat the Internship 
course before moving to the next level. Prior to or after receiving a NC, a referral may be made 
to the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC).  In order to repeat the course, 
additional remedial work may be required.  The Intern may repeat Internship one time only.  A 
mark of NC during the second Internship attempt will result in dismissal from the program. 
NOTE: The decision to give NC to an Intern will be made by the faculty supervisor. If the Intern 
wishes to challenge this decision, the Intern must follow the Academic Appeal and Review 
Process.  If the Intern is informed that he or she will be dismissed from the program, the 
student’s faculty advisor will meet with the Intern to discuss alternative 
educational/employment options.  A referral could also be made to the Director of Career 
Services for assistance. 
The Intern may receive “NC” for one (or more) of the following reasons: 
1. More than (2) two total absences during Faculty Group Supervision over Internship and 
Advanced Internship (CPY 6700 I and CPY 6710 I). A student cannot have more than one

absence per semester. 
2. Inadequate, incomplete, or unacceptable Case Study presentations (as determined by the 
Instructor/Faculty Supervisor).  
3. Disciplinary actions that are the result of unprofessional/unethical conduct either at the 
Practicum/Internship site or in the classroom and/or failure to comply with directions and 
consultation given by either the Faculty Supervisor or any Site Supervisor. All disciplinary 
problems will be documented in the student’s file. 
4. If the Faculty Supervisor determines that the student’s current emotional, mental or physical 
well-being compromises the integrity of the Practicum/Internship experience or potentially 
places the student or others in harm’s way or in an unduly vulnerable position. All such cases 
will be brought to the attention of the Clinical Coordinator and the Program Chair. 
5. If there is a question or concern of competency in areas such as (but not limited to): 
a. Interpersonal and professional competence (e.g., the ways in which a student relates to 
clients, peers, faculty, allied professionals, the public, and individuals from diverse 
backgrounds or histories) 
b. Self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-evaluation (e.g., knowledge of the content and 
potential impact of one's own beliefs and values on clients, peers, faculty, allied 
professionals, the public, and individuals from diverse backgrounds or histories) 
c. Openness to processes of supervision (e.g., the ability and willingness to explore issues 
that either interfere with the appropriate provision of care or impede professional 
development or functioning) 
d. Resolution of problems or issues that interfere with professional development or 
functioning in a satisfactory manner (e.g., by responding constructively to feedback 
from supervisors or program faculty; by participating in personal therapy in order to 
resolve problems or issues) 
 
Please note: At any point during the internship evaluation process, a student may be subject to 
referral to the SPDC. 
2. Subjective Component of Credit/No Credit Grading  
In the final analysis, all grading is subjective.  It is highly dependent upon the observations, 
experience, and professional and academic judgments of the Counseling Department faculty. The 
decision to award “Credit” or “No-Credit” decisions is based upon how Interns respond to and 
achieve what the faculty supervisor has determined should be achieved, in recordings, paperwork, 
group supervision and feedback, case presentations, completion of readings, and on other tasks. 
The award of “Credit” or “No Credit” is also developed within a comparative analysis with other 
Interns.  The reality is that not all Interns in Internship work at the same level. Not all have set the 
same goals, possess the same clinical skills or cognitive capabilities, or have the same level of 
interest, work ethic, experiential background, or maturity. Therefore, some Interns may not receive 
a credit for the course. When Interns have Site Supervisors along with a faculty supervisor, the 
faculty supervisor will make the final decision as to whether an Intern will receive “Credit” or “No-
Credit” for the class. The feedback from the Site Supervisor will be requested and incorporated into 
the final decision; however, the final decision remains with the faculty supervisor.   
Site Supervisor Concerns Regarding Interns                                                                                            
If the Site Supervisor perceives that the Intern is not meeting minimal standards of competence at the 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025

internship site, the Site Supervisor will identify challenges and possible solutions for the Intern.  If the 
Site Supervisor believes additional work is necessary for the Intern, a written remedial plan will be 
developed by mid semester. The remedial plan will need to be completed in its entirety by the end of 
the semester. A copy of this remedial plan will be given to the Intern and the internship supervisor. If a 
remedial plan cannot be agreed upon between the Site Supervisor and the Intern, the Internship Faculty 
will be notified.  Faculty will meet (or correspond by phone) with the Intern and the Site Supervisor and 
make a reasonable attempt to help all parties reach a satisfactory agreement.   
In the case of irresolvable conflicts and up to the three-quarter point in the semester, the Intern has the 
opportunity to obtain a new Site Supervisor at the present site if a new Site Supervisor is available.  If an 
alternative Site Supervisor is not available at that site the Intern may obtain an alternative site and 
alternative Site Supervisor.  The Intern will need to discuss these plans with faculty.  If the Intern decides 
to obtain an alternative supervisor, the remedial work assigned by the original Site Supervisor must still 
be completed to the full satisfaction of faculty.  Please note: At any point during the internship 
evaluation process, a student may be subject to referral to the SPDC. 
Intern Concerns Regarding the Site Supervisor                                                                                       
If the Intern has concerns/conflict with the Site Supervisor the Intern should meet with the Site 
Supervisor to attempt to resolve the stated concerns (if the concerns are regarding a perceived 
ethical/moral violation on the part of the Site Supervisor, the Intern would be advised to discuss this 
with faculty).  If a resolution cannot be achieved then the Intern should contact the faculty supervisor.  
Faculty will contact the Site Supervisor to make a reasonable attempt to help all parties reach a 
satisfactory agreement.  If a resolution cannot be achieved for the Intern, then the Intern reserves the 
right to select an alternative supervisor/site. 
Miscellaneous re: Clinical Work 
Dress Code for Counseling Skills, Practicum, Internship, and Advanced Internship                       
Students should dress modestly and professionally when meeting with students/clients for Counseling 
Skills, Practicum, Internship or Advanced Internship. Casual clothing such as jeans, overalls, shorts, t-
shirts, sweatshirts, etc., should be avoided. If the student is working with an agency for Practicum, 
Internship, or Advanced Internship, the dress code of that agency should be followed. 
Liability Insurance                                                                                                                                     
Students in Practicum, and Internship/Advanced Internship are required to purchase liability insurance 
prior to clinical classes.  Specific information regarding the liability insurance requirement is available via 
the class syllabus and on the portal. 
Confidentiality of Client Information                                                                                                  
Students have an ethical obligation to protect the privacy and confidentiality of clients and volunteers 
who role-play clients. Files that are stored on a laptop or home computer should be password-protected 
and no one except the Counselor-in-Training should know the password. No client information should 
be transmitted electronically by email without the approval of the faculty supervisor or course 
instructor. Client information that is shared in writing for supervision or grading purposes should have 
all identifying information redacted.  Pseudonyms should be used to refer to clients during live

APPENDIX B: Memorandum Agreement 
 
 
 Memorandum Agreement 
 
Students are required to read, sign, and submit this form each year 
 
The program faculty in the Department of Graduate Counseling at Grace College believes that 
the interpersonal awareness and growth of counseling students is a demonstration of Christian 
integrity and a prime requisite for proficiency as a counselor. Therefore, in addition to academic 
performance, faculty evaluate all counseling students to determine competence in 
interpersonal skills, self-awareness, and professional behavior as outlined in the Department of 
Graduate Counseling Catalog and Student Handbook section entitled DOGC Retention Criteria. 
If faculty perceive that personal issues may be impacting a student’s ability to demonstrate 
these successfully, faculty are ethically required to evaluate and recommend a remedial course 
of action.  Typically, that recommendation involves professional counseling for the student with 
a non-DOGC- affiliated mental health provider. If personal issues are not resolved, the faculty of 
the Department of Graduate Counseling, through the Student Professional Development 
Committee process, in conjunction with the Dean of the School of Behavioral Sciences will 
review the appropriateness of the student’s continuance in the counseling program. 
 
The above is in compliance with the ACA Ethical Guidelines (2014), Sections F.8.c., 
F.8.d., F.9.a., and F.9.b., pp. 14 – 15. 
 
I have read and understood the above statements.

others so that we reach maturity together? This course will help you see that ministry is not just about 
doing the ministry yourself, but teaching others to join you in various arenas of ministry. You will learn

of God and attend to another in the midst of their journey. The learner will have the opportunity to see 
and reject patterns of self-talk (based on the flesh) in order to embrace Spirit-led patters of soul talk. 
The care of souls is an interpersonal part of ministry leadership that often gets overlooked in our

Note about the Catalog 
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs.  
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs. The 
provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded as a 
contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies governing 
admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. Grace reserves the right to 
change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without prior notice including 
academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, personnel, academic 
policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any courses described in the 
catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, make every attempt to 
give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog content when possible 
and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year.  
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student. 
 
Course Descriptions 
In the following courses, students will be explorers (not just observers) in the study of the Bible. The 
goal is to become skilled in interpretation and wise in application. Courses will focus on breadth and 
depth of learning, so that students are capable of dealing with both specific and global issues in the text.

Computer Usage/Web Site/Blogs/Social Media  
Grace College realizes the value added to technology and relationship building through use of

limited to: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok and Tumblr), websites, and/or other 
creative content. This includes “anonymous” content that can reasonably be traced back or 
attributed to a Grace student. Ultimately, Grace students are responsible for what they post or 
comment online. Therefore, students should not post content on social media that violates 
Grace community lifestyle policies. Posts or comments that are harassing or discriminatory to 
individuals or groups of people, or that reveal community standard violations, will result in 
consequences. Students must comply with copyright laws, file sharing laws, and avoid 
plagiarism. See our “Academic Integrity” policy for more details.  
HLC Criteria as Applied to the School of Professional and Online Education  
Faculty teaching in the School of Professional and Online Education should have completed a program of 
study in the discipline or subfield in which they teach, and/or for which they develop curricula, with the 
coursework at least one level above that of the courses being taught or developed/or a current teaching 
or administrator license in the field. The School of Professional and Online Education can determine that 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog 2023-2025 
Degree Completion    3                                                                                           April 2023 
a faculty member is qualified based on experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the 
degree it would otherwise require for a faculty position. 
 
• 
Faculty teaching UNDERGRADUATE COURSES should hold a degree at least one level above that 
of the program in which they are teaching. Those faculty members teaching general education 
courses, or other non-occupational courses, hold a master’s degree or higher in the discipline or 
subfield. If a faculty member holds a master’s degree or higher in a discipline or subfield other 
than that in which he or she is teaching, that faculty member should have completed a 
minimum of 18 graduate hours in the discipline or subfield in which they teach. The School of 
Professional and Online Education has determined that an M.B.A. degree qualifies an instructor 
to teach all undergraduate business-related courses in the Weber, Degree Completion, as well 
as any other existing or new programs. An instructor with a master’s degree can teach GOL 3000 
Adult Learner or GOL 3010 Fundamentals of Lifelong Learning because these two courses are 
very introductory in nature and teach the fundamentals of learning and how to succeed in an 
undergraduate setting.  Furthermore, the School of Professional and Online Education can 
determine that a faculty member is qualified based on experience that the institution 
determines is equivalent to the degree it would otherwise require for a faculty position. See the 
SPOE Process for Exceptions. 
 
• 
Faculty teaching UNDERGRADUATE BIBLE/THEOLOGY-RELATED courses should hold a degree at 
least one level above that of the program in which they are teaching. Those faculty members 
teaching general education courses, or other non-occupational courses, hold a master’s degree 
or higher in the discipline or subfield. If a faculty member holds a master’s degree or higher in a 
discipline or subfield other than that in which he or she is teaching, that faculty member should 
have completed a minimum of 18 graduate hours in the discipline or subfield in which they 
teach. The School of Professional and Online Education has determined that an M.Div or other 
Bible-related degree qualifies an instructor to teach all undergraduate Bible-related courses in 
the Weber, Degree Completion, as well as other existing or new programs. Furthermore, the 
School of Professional and Online Education can determine that a faculty member is qualified 
based on experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the degree it would 
otherwise require for a faculty position. See the SPOE Process for Exceptions. 
 
School of Professional and Online Education Process for Exceptions 
HLC Assumed Practice B.2 allows an institution to determine that a faculty member is qualified based on 
experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the degree it would otherwise require for a 
faculty position. This experience should be tested experience in that it includes a breadth and depth of 
experience outside of the classroom in real-world situations relevant to the discipline in which the faculty 
member would be teaching. An institution that intends to use tested experience as a basis for hiring 
faculty must have a well-defined policy and procedure for determining when such experience is sufficient 
to determine that the faculty member has the expertise necessary to teach students in that discipline. 
 
Deans and faculty leaders assess faculty members’ qualifications. Endorsements are considered when 
potential instructors do not have the academic credentials required by the Higher Learning Commission. 
These endorsements are dependent on the relevancy of the experience both to the degree level and to 
the specific content of the course for which the faculty member is responsible. These endorsements 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog 2023-2025 
Degree Completion    4                                                                                           April 2023 
come in two forms: Endorsement by Equivalency and Endorsement by Exception. These endorsements 
are used when credentialing part-time instructors.  
 
ENDORSEMENT BY EQUIVALENCY is used when it is evident that an instructor has credentials that are 
“equivalent to” the degree required of our faculty in that content area.  This endorsement is in line with 
HLC guidelines that allow an individual’s knowledge and expertise to be determined by his or her tested 
experiences outside of the classroom in real-world situations relevant to the discipline in which the 
faculty member would be teaching. For example, an instructor can be credentialed to teach if that 
instructor has a minimum of ten years of industry-specific experience. Such life experience can qualify as 
an equivalent to academic credentials for the purpose of teaching, based on the judgment of 
knowledgeable faculty in the discipline. This endorsement is used when in faculty judgment it is not 
necessary for an instructor to pursue further studies to teach at the college in the approved area. 
 
ENDORSEMENT BY EXCEPTION is used when an instructor has demonstrated adequate knowledge and 
experience but has not met our standard for credentials. An example of such a situation would be the 
instructor who has a bachelor’s/master’s degree in a different teaching field, but has some 
certifications, professional affiliations, and a minimum of five years industry-specific or teaching 
experience.  
 
NOTE ABOUT THE CATALOG 
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs. 
 
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs. 
 The provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded 
as a contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies 
governing admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. 
 
Grace reserves the right to change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without 
prior notice including academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, 
personnel, academic policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any 
courses described in the catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, 
make every attempt to give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog 
content when possible and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
 
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year. 
 
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student.

In some programs, students are asked to acknowledge in writing their receipt of the program’s catalog.  
Changes to an academic catalog that are necessary following the start of the fall semester will be noted 
as an addendum to the original catalog.  
 
Archived catalogs are maintained on the institution’s Web site. 
It is each student’s responsibility to schedule regular meetings with his or her academic advisor and to 
be knowledgeable about institutional requirements, academic regulations, and calendar deadlines 
specified in the catalogs and academic program publications. Students should read the catalog carefully 
and consult with an advisor to determine how these policies relate to their individual circumstances.

Part-time Students: Part-time students are those enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate program 
for at least 3 hours of credit during a regular semester. 
 
Auditors:  Students who desire to hear the lectures in a course without undertaking the coursework for 
credit may be admitted as auditors to selected courses by making proper application with the Online 
Admissions Office. Though no credits or grade points are involved, auditors are required to pay the 
appropriate fees and to meet class attendance requirements. Those who do not meet attendance 
requirements will receive the “grade” of “W,” whether or not they have officially withdrawn. 
 
Auditing is not permitted for some courses. (This policy is at the discretion of the department or 
professor involved.) For some courses, auditing is permitted only if the student completes the course 
assignments as specified by the professor. An auditor may enroll for only one semester as a “full-time” 
auditor.  
 
Note about the Catalog  
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs. 
 
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs. 
 
The provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded 
as a contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies 
governing admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. 
 
Grace reserves the right to change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without 
prior notice including academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, 
personnel, academic policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any 
courses described in the catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, 
make every attempt to give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog 
content when possible and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
 
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year. 
 
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student. 
 
 In some programs, students are asked to acknowledge in writing their receipt of the program’s catalog.

Changes to an academic catalog that are necessary following the start of the fall semester will be noted 
as an addendum to the original catalog.  
 
Archived catalogs are maintained on the institution’s Web site. 
 
It is each student’s responsibility to schedule regular meetings with his or her academic advisor and to 
be knowledgeable about institutional requirements, academic regulations, and calendar deadlines 
specified in the catalogs and academic program publications. Students should read the catalog carefully 
and consult with an advisor to determine how these policies relate to their individual circumstances.

COURSE DESCRIPTIONS "
NPM 5015,Nonprofit Management as a Career ,0,"People view nonprofits from different perspectives, some considering them to be social institutions and 
others considering them to be more like business firms with a social purpose. This course attempts to 
blend these perspectives and to provide a balanced overview of the field. 
Although some people portray nonprofits as less well-managed than businesses, that perspective is 
often inaccurate. This course will encourage students preparing for careers in nonprofit management to 
proceed with pride and confidence that their field is as distinguished as management in business or 
government.  Together we will thoroughly pursue an understanding of how a nonprofit management 
career brings challenges but also rewards. 
 "
NPM 5010,Foundations of Nonprofit Management ,Three,"This course will provide an orientation to the nonprofit sector and a theoretical foundation for the more 
applied topics that will be covered later in MSNM Program. Students will begin to develop their personal 
philosophies of management as it applies to the unique environment of the nonprofits. This course 
seeks to engender an overview of nonprofit management that is both conceptual and practical in 
nature.  Three hours. "
NPM 5020,Governing and Leading Nonprofit Organizations ,Three,"This course provides learners with the opportunity to learn the many dynamics involved in leading an 
organization under the auspices of a governing board. Best practice strategies and activities will be 
utilized regarding effective and ethical leadership, managing an organization, and recruiting, developing, 
evaluating and retaining human capital within the organization.  Three hours. "
NPM 5030,Obtaining and Managing Resources for Nonprofit Organizations ,0,"Introduces students to the major financial management concepts and techniques required for effective 
management of nonprofit organizations. Offers students an opportunity to learn about nonprofit 
accounting, budget management, cash flow management, financial statements and reports. 
 "
NPM 5040,Managing the Nonprofit Organization ,Three,"Nonprofit organizations can thrive only when there is a clear understanding of the internal and external 
realities that impact a company’s present status and potential for growth. This course will examine 
various ways to ensure accountability to external stakeholders and effectively measure performance. 
The strategic planning process will also be examined in depth, and students will learn how to utilize 
planning skills in a practical exercise with a company of their choice. Students will also examine ways to 
help nonprofit companies build capacity and explore opportunities for collaboration.  Three hours. "
NPM 5050,"Marketing, Communication and Special Topics for Nonprofit Organizations ",Three,"This course is a guide through four topics that can easily be confusing or too new for nonprofit leaders 
to handle without help. 1) Leaders, must know the values and pitfalls of marketing so that the mission 
remains the primary focus. 2) Advocacy includes education of the public in addition to the challenging 
topic of lobbying that few nonprofits engage in with confidence. 3) Globalization affects many local 
nonprofits as there may be chapters abroad. Leaders must be aware of the management and board 
'best practices' that come from globalized nonprofits. 4) Social entrepreneurship is a newer topic that 
covers innovation to provide new income streams for a target population, social impact or both. 
Business for missions, community development, and micro finance are related topics.  Three hours.

and entities specializing in nonprofit financial management as well. With this growth in numbers comes 
a comparable growth in the demand for sophisticated management. No longer is it enough just for one's
