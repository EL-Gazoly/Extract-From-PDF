UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS 
Associate of Arts and Science Degrees 
Grace College offers an associate degree in Liberal Arts that is delivered in different modalities.  The 
Associate of Science degree in Liberal Arts is available online for high school graduates. The College 
Launch program offers this same degree in Liberal Arts for those in high school, this format is offered on 
main campus and online. The Associate of Science degree in Liberal Arts is comprised of general 
education courses, which then enables students to easily pursue a bachelor’s degree. 
 
Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science 
Grace College offers a variety of majors leading to the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Bachelor of Science 
(B.S.) degrees. In cooperation with Bethel University, students may also receive a Bachelor of Science in 
Nursing (B.S.N.) degree.  
Most majors require a minor. Specific program requirements are available in the respective catalog 
section of each department and at the Registrar’s Office.  
In addition to the 39 credit hours of the Grace Core, students enroll in 6 additional credit hours specific 
to the B.A. or the B.S. degree. Students who select a B.A. degree take 6 credits of a modern or ancient 
language. Students who select a B.S. degree take 6 credits of science, math, or social science outside 
their chosen discipline.

degree includes the successful completion of one major, one minor (if required), the Grace Core (39 
credits), 6 credits specific to the B.A. or the B.S., and 12 credits of applied learning.  
Blended Degrees 
Students electing to graduate in three years might consider choosing the blended degree option whereby 
they complete both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in four years by pursuing one of the 
institution’s several online master’s programs (see associated program catalogs). A student can complete 
both a bachelor’s degree and the Master of Divinity degree through the Seminary in five years.  Degrees are

conferred simultaneously and students are able to retain their financial aid for four years by completing both 
degrees concurrently. More information about degrees that are available as part of the blended degree 
option can be found on the Accelerated Master’s Program page of the institution’s website, by contacting the 
School of Professional and Online Education, or from the student’s academic advisor. More information 
about financial aid can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. 
 
STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAMS 
Grace College students have the opportunity to study at international institutions with which Grace College 
has developed exchange agreements. Currently, an exchange program has been established with Handong 
Global University in Pohang, South Korea, and Karoli Gaspar University of the Reformed Church in Hungary in 
Budapest, Hungary.  
To be eligible to participate in an exchange program, students must be at least a sophomore, in good 
academic standing, meet all the general Study Abroad requirements, and meet any requirements set forth by 
the host institution. 
Costs for the various programs may vary depending on the details of each agreement, but generally students 
pay regular tuition to Grace College, and room and board to the host institution. In most cases, students may 
use their institutional aid irrespective of their major.  All travel fees (passport, visas, airfare, etc.) are the 
student’s responsibility. 
Classes taken at host institutions are posted to the transcript as Grace College credits and applied toward the 
student’s major requirements if he or she completes a course, and given that the student has filled out the 
proper petitions, in consultation with his/her advisor, prior to participating in the exchange program. 
For more information about exchange programs contact the Institute for Global Studies. 
Study Abroad Programs 
Grace College is vitally interested in encouraging students to expand their global awareness. To enrich their 
cross-cultural experience, numerous opportunities are available for study abroad. These experiences are 
available through the Institute for Global Studies for language and non-language majors and some minors 
and for students planning cross-cultural experiences to meet their general education requirements for the 
Global Perspectives course. In addition to these programs, other cross-cultural opportunities are available 
through summer cross-cultural opportunities. Students are encouraged to take advantage of these 
experiences to broaden their global awareness. 
The Institute for Global Studies at Grace College coordinates cross-cultural experiences for both language and 
non-language majors.  
The Study Abroad for Languages 
For language majors and some minors, Grace’s Study Abroad Program requires qualified students to 
study abroad. Through this cross-cultural, immersive language experience, students become more proficient 
speakers while learning to appreciate other cultures. They are placed with a host family, participate in the life 
of a local church, and are enrolled in some of the world’s best-known universities with whom Grace has 
transfer and credit agreements. By signing a language pledge, students commit to speak the target language 
throughout their experience and therefore attain near-native fluency by the end of the program. 
For their overseas experience, Spanish students have the choice of studying in the capital of Argentina, 
Buenos Aires; San José, Costa Rica; or in Madrid, Spain. French students study in the beautiful city of 
Dijon, France, capital of Burgundy or in Quebec, Canada.

study abroad programs such as CCCUGlobalEd through the Council of Christian Colleges and Universities 
(CCCU) or through Grace's exchange program at Handong Global University. 
For further information regarding academic requirements, financial arrangements, and schedule

PRE-PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS                                                                                                                          
Some disciplines offer pre-professional programs including the disciplines of political science (pre-law), 
and health science (e.g., pre-med, pre-veterinary, etc.). Details about these programs are available in 
the respective academic sections of this catalog and from the department. 
Pre-Law Program 
Students preparing for law school are encouraged to consider the pre-law program. Students may 
choose from a broad range of majors, will be assigned a pre-law advisor, may declare a pre-law minor, 
will have internship possibilities, and may compete in our award-winning mediation team. Further 
details are included under the Department of Humanities, which administers this rigorous program.  
Pre-Professional Health Science Programs 
The Department of Science and Mathematics manages pre-professional programs in dentistry, medicine, 
optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, physical therapy, and veterinary medicine along with a 
number of other less common professional programs. Students preparing for graduate study in an area 
of healthcare can usually meet the specific requirements for admission to their respective professional 
programs by pursuing a department major in biology or health science (both with B.A. or B.S. options). 
Students may major in any other discipline as long as they include in their course selection those courses 
required for admission by the professional programs for which they are seeking admission. The 
admission requirements for any professional program may be obtained online directly from the 
professional schools or from the Grace College Health Professions Advisor.  
Students preparing for health science graduate study should identify the admission requirements of one 
or more specific graduate programs in their field of interest early in the advising process. This is 
important to plan the most effective pre-professional program at Grace since some schools may have 
requirements outside the standard courses required by most schools in that area. 
More information on the correlation between the Health Science concentrations and the specific 
requirements for graduate health science program are available from a Health Professions advisor. A 
meeting with an advisor will assist the student to plan an effective, broad course of study emphasizing 
required science classes within the context of a liberal arts education (valued by health science graduate 
programs). 
Pre-Seminary Program Advanced Standing 
Grace College students can gain advanced standing toward several master’s programs at Grace 
Theological Seminary in the following ways: 
1. Greek and Hebrew language courses taken while a Grace College student are accepted by the 
seminary with all fees waived. However, the student must have earned a minimum grade of “B-” in 
each class.

2. A student may gain additional hours of credit by testing. To qualify to take a test there must have 
been a similar course taken in the college and the minimum grade earned must be no less than “B-.” 
A list of courses available for testing can be obtained from the seminary office. 
3. Some courses are accepted without testing provided the student has earned the minimum grade of 
“B-.”  
Maximum limits have been established for the various master’s programs in accordance with the 
seminary accreditation standards. More information about advanced standing may be obtained from 
the School of Ministry Studies or the student’s faculty advisor.

also challenge our students to develop an approach to learning that fosters a vibrant life of the mind, 
artful creativity, a compassionate embrace of human societies, and a thirst to explore all that God has 
created. To this end, our faculty mentor their students, inspiring them not only toward excellence in 
their respective fields, but to live purposeful lives dedicated to following Christ as they discover 
knowledge, apply the power of creative imagination, help to improve the human condition in all of its 
diversity, and work to extend the presence of God's kingdom while living in the hope of Christ’s return.  
Goals 
• 
To help our students develop an understanding of the integration of faith and learning so that 
they can pursue scholarship that is both worthy of their profession and inspired by great 
Christian themes (i.e. salvation, love, reconciliation, justice, grace, honesty, truth, peace, 
perseverance, stewardship, etc.). 
• 
To develop encouraging and challenging learning experiences that engage our students in real 
world applications, which are transformational in nature. 
• 
To mentor our students so they become highly competent in their respective callings. 
• 
To instill in our students a sense of purpose that leads them toward kingdom living.

Department Purpose  
To be human is to be in relationship to others. The relationships created through language, culture, 
literature, history, and politics profoundly shape our views and experiences while influencing every 
aspect of society. We believe that sustained study of these relationships enhances our understanding of 
our Creator, others, and ourselves. Moreover, we recognize that learning from diverse individuals and 
civilizations, both past and present, equips students to be future shapers of cultural and societal forces 
in both their personal lives and their varied careers. To that end, the Department of Humanities exists to 
promote the value of the humanities and the study thereof. Our department comprises four distinct yet 
interrelated programs: English and Journalism, Communication, History and Political Science, and 
Modern Languages. Additionally, our department is the academic home of Grace’s unique 
interdisciplinary studies major as well as two Graduate Badges offered through partnership with Purdue 
University.  
Department of Humanities Grace Core Requirements 
The humanities are a strong component of the Grace Core curriculum. Grace Core courses offered 
through the Department of Humanities include ENG 1100 Effective Writing, COM 1100 Public Speaking, 
HIS 1350 Current Issues in Historical Context, HUM 2000 Global Perspectives, and French and Spanish 
courses that may be used to fulfill the language and culture proficiency requirement for the Bachelor of 
Arts degree. For more information about the B.A. language proficiency requirement, see the Modern 
Languages Program section below. 
English and Journalism Program                                                                 
Recognizing that God is the creator of language, Grace’s English and Journalism Program seeks to 
deepen students’ understanding of the complexities and creative potential of language. Our English 
curriculum acquaints students with a wide variety of literature and interpretive approaches and 
enhances students’ critical thinking, research, and communication skills. The journalism major and 
minor equip students for careers in journalistic media and related fields. Both the English and journalism 
majors provide opportunities for practical, hands-on experience through involvement with our campus 
newspaper, literary magazine, and other publications, as well as off-campus internships and experiential 
learning. 
 
The English and Journalism Program offers a major in English, a major in English education, a major in 
journalism, a minor in English, a minor in creative writing, and a minor in journalism.

History and Political Science Program 
Our purpose is seen in our motto: Memores acti prudentes potest, meaning: “Mindful of what has been 
done, aware of what is possible.” Through our program’s common experience curriculum, a variety of 
elective offerings, engaging applied learning experiences, and a capstone seminar, we encourage our 
students to think incarnationally about their field of study. This means we engage with them in the 
fascinating yet messy endeavor of studying the record of past and present civilization in all of its 
humanness. As apprentice scholars, students are not to rush to judgment, but are to understand other

cultures within the context in which they are situated. Along with this, they are to become ready to 
engage in the type of social responsibility befitting a citizen both of this world and of Christ’s Kingdom. 
In this way, we hope their time in the History and Political Science Program will be a transformational 
experience that prepares students for a life of service in an engaging profession. 
A major in history prepares students for a number of professions and/or graduate work in museums, 
archives, historic preservation, public history, journalism, government service, law, business 
administration and management, and research. The pre-law program equips students for law school 
where they can prepare for a career in advocacy. Careers in political science include legislators, legal 
investigators, lawyers, mediators, law librarians, judges/judicial workers, judiciary interpreters and 
translators, public affairs specialists, labor relations managers, and management analysts. The social 
studies education major prepares students for many of the same careers as the history major while also 
equipping them to teach economics, geography, US and world history, political science, psychology, 
and/or sociology at the upper elementary, middle, and high school levels once they are certified. 
 
Program Learning Outcomes

1. Students are able to clearly define a problem or thesis within their discipline and organize a 
project to address that problem or thesis.

of social studies. 
2. Students are able to reflect on and attend to issues of equity, diversity, access, power, and 
human rights. 
3. Students demonstrate knowledge of issues of injustice and corresponding action and advocacy.

criminal justice, psychology, information technology, mathematics, biology, and Spanish). The ABA and 
most law schools do NOT recommend that pre-law students take a pre-law major - therefore, we do not

The Study Abroad Program 
Grace’s Study Abroad Program enables qualified language majors to study abroad. Through this cross-
cultural, immersive language experience, students become more proficient speakers while learning to 
appreciate other cultures. They are placed with a host family, participate in the life of a local church, and 
are enrolled in some of the world’s best-known universities, with which Grace has transfer and credit 
agreements. Students sign a language pledge committing to speak the target language throughout their 
experience and therefore attain near-native fluency by the end of the program. With the help of the 
Institute for Global Studies and in consultation with their advisor, students select a program of study 
covering a wide variety of areas and disciplines in the target language. 
 
Language majors may satisfy their study abroad requirement by taking courses at the following 
approved member universities: 
STA 0400 Universidad de Belgrano – Buenos Aires, Argentina 
STA 0460 Universidad Antonio de Nebrija – Madrid, Spain 
STA 0430 Université de Bourgogne – Dijon, France 
STA 0540 Université Laval – Quebec, Canada 
 
Students typically register for 16–18 credit hours during a fall and spring semester and 12 credit hours 
during a summer term. 
 
Students can participate in the following programs for languages not offered on campus (Korean, Arabic, 
Hungarian, German, etc.). 
STA 0620  Middle East Studies Program 
STX 3000  Handong Global University Exchange  
 
STA 0560 
Sommerhochschule of the Universitat Wien – Vienna, Austria  
 
STX 4000    Károli Gáspár University of the Reformed Church in Hungary –Budapest, Hungary 
 
For further information regarding current member institutions and courses offered, please contact the 
Modern Languages Program Director or Institute for Global Studies. Study Abroad Program locations 
and institutions are subject to change, based upon availability. 
 
Language students are required to take the Oral Proficiency Interview (OPIc) to evaluate their 
proficiency in their target language. For students in the language education program, the minimum level 
for graduation is Advanced Low. 
Bachelor of Arts Language Requirement 
The Bachelor of Arts degree requires that students demonstrate proficiency in a single language. This 
may be accomplished in the following ways: 
● Students complete two courses (6 hours) in a single modern or ancient language (e.g., Spanish, 
French, Hebrew, Greek, or any language currently offered through Go Study or Go Exchange). 
Students with prior language instruction and/or strong language skills may take the online 
Foreign Language Placement Exam (FLPE) to determine in which course level to enroll. 
● Students who place into the 2020-level of a language (e.g., SPA 2020) based on the online 
Foreign Language Placement Exam (FLPE) may contact the Modern Languages Program Director 
and arrange to take the department exam. The fee for the department exam is $120. Students 
who score in the “Intermediate Mid” level on the department exam may receive credit for 2010 
(3 hours), and enroll in 2020 (3 hours) to satisfy the B.A. language requirement. Students

wishing to pursue this option should schedule the department exam within the first four weeks 
of their first semester at Grace College and Seminary. 
● Students who place beyond the 2020-level of a language (e.g., SPA 2100) based on the online 
Foreign Language Placement Exam (FLPE) may contact the Modern Languages Program Director 
and arrange to take the department exam. The fee for the department exam is $120. Students 
who score in the “Intermediate High” level on the department exam may receive credit for 2010 
and 2020 (6 hours), thereby satisfying the B.A. language requirement. Students wishing to 
pursue this option should schedule the department exam within the first four weeks of their 
first semester at Grace College and Seminary. 
● Students may earn language credits based on their Advanced Placement (AP) language exam 
score. Students with a score of 4 or 5 on an AP language exam receive credit for 1020 (3 hours) 
and enroll in 2010 to satisfy the B.A. language requirement.  
Foreign Language Placement Examination (FLPE)  
Students with previous language experience in Spanish or French should complete the Foreign Language 
Placement Examination (FLPE) prior to arriving on campus. There is no cost for the placement exam. Go 
to http://bit.ly/2P9yP76. You will need to enter your Grace Student ID. Each question is selected based 
on previous responses and the test is usually completed within 30 to 45 minutes. Please note that the 
online Foreign Language Placement Exam (FLPE) is a placement exam only; no credits will be awarded 
based on the FLPE.  
 
Department Exam 
Students who place into or beyond the 2020-level on the Foreign Language Placement Examination 
(FLPE) may contact the Modern Languages Program Director to arrange to take the department exam, 
which is the ACTFL OPIc. Unlike the FLPE, the department exam is a credit-bearing exam that tests oral 
proficiency. The fee for the department exam is $120. Students who score in the “Intermediate Mid” 
level on the department exam receive credit for 2010 (3 credits). Students who score in the 
“Intermediate High” level receive credit for 2010 and 2020 (6 credits). Students who score below the 
“Intermediate Mid” level on the department exam receive no credits. Students must schedule the 
department exam within the first four weeks of their first semester at Grace College and Seminary. 
 
CLEP Examination  
CLEP Examination Credits may not be used to satisfy the B.A. language requirement. Students who 
complete a foreign language CLEP exam will receive general elective credit that will count toward overall 
credits needed to graduate.  
 
International Students and Foreign Transfer Credits 
Students who have received the equivalent of a high school diploma in a country in which the primary 
language is other than English may be granted the language requirement for a B.A. through transfer 
credits. In order to receive the 6 transfer credits, students must submit the foreign high school transcript 
to the Modern Languages Program Director for approval. 
Modern Languages Majors 
The French and Spanish majors provide an opportunity for focused study in a single language. The 
requirement for the language majors is 40-42 credit hours in the department. A minor is required. For 
most language majors, at least 12 credit hours must be taken through an approved study abroad 
program.

Purpose:  
The department’s purpose is to prepare students in knowledge and skills for advanced achievement of 
their combined capabilities in the select areas of visual and performing arts. These include studio, 
technology, theory, analysis, history, and performance, composition/improvisation, and repertory.. 
Goal:  
In preparation for professional careers in the visual  and performing arts our goal is to provide students 
with studies, practice, and experiences from a Christ-centered perspective that will serve to guide in the 
development of their ability to: 1) demonstrate excellence in creative work, 2) achieve competency in 
the use of tools and technology in their areas of specialty, and 3) articulate analytical perceptions in 
theoretical, cultural and stylistic contexts. 
Faith Integration:  
We look to scripture to understand the source of our creativity. In Genesis 1:1, we read, In the 
beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.  Foundational art methods of concept, process, 
product, and critique are revealed in Genesis 1:2-4. When the earth was in darkness, God 
conceptualized light. Next came His process and product. He spoke the words, Let there be light, and 
there was light. He then evaluated what He had made and proclaimed that it was good.3 
 
Because creativity is an act of worship, our work is infused with our faith. As artists, we envision the 
great Creator. Being made in His image, we strive to achieve His example of excellence so that we, too, 
can evaluate our creative work as good.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 
Of all fields of engineering, mechanical engineering is the most diverse and general. Mechanical 
engineers can be found working in almost any industry. Manufacturing, transportation, health care, and 
insurance are just a few of the types of firms that employ mechanical engineers. No other field of 
engineering provides a better professional base for interdisciplinary activities. 
 
Mechanical engineers design machines of all types, from bicycles to spacecraft. They plan, design, and 
direct the manufacture, distribution, and operation of these machines. Mechanical engineers also design 
the power sources needed to operate the machines and provide for the environment in which they 
function. In fact, mechanical engineering involves all phases of energy production and utilization: 
engines, power plants, electrical generation, heating, ventilating, and air conditioning. 
 
 
Mechanical Engineering Student Learning Outcomes 
 
The Department of Engineering supports Grace College’s emphasis on strengthening character, 
sharpening competence, and preparing for service.

June 2023 
 
God’s creation. This program has been designed to emphasize hands-on, field-based learning in addition 
to classroom instruction.  
Exercise Science  
The Grace College Exercise Science program develops Christ followers who apply Biblical values as they 
prepare for careers in Exercise Science or medical education graduate school in the areas of physical or 
occupational therapy, and additional Health and Wellness professions through academic classes and 
applied learning experiences. 
Life Science Education 
The life science education major is designed for students who desire to teach science, particularly 
biology, at the high school level. This program prepares students in the mainstream areas of modern life 
science in preparation for a career in either public or private schools.  
Mathematics Education 
The mathematics education major provides preparation for careers in high school and middle school 
mathematics teaching. Students will build a deep understanding of mathematics so that they are 
prepared to teach math effectively regardless of changing standards.  
Actuarial Science 
The Actuarial Science major is for students seeking a career as an actuary. Actuaries are interdisciplinary 
problem solvers who use mathematics, computers, finance, accounting, and economics to help 
companies and organizations assess risk. Students are prepared for the probability exam in the fall of 
their sophomore or junior year. 
BIOLOGY AND HEALTH PROFESSIONS PROGRAM 
Biology is the study of the science of living organisms from the smallest bacterium to the largest of the 
great whales. The mission of the biology and health professions program at Grace College is to study 
biology as a science from the perspective of individuals who believe that all life and life processes are a 
result of God’s creation. We believe that the details of biological structure and function from the 
molecular to the grand anatomical level display the magnificent design of God the Creator. The key 
phrases of strengthening character, developing competence, and preparing for service from the mission 
statement of Grace College drive the mission of the biology and health professions program. While the 
curriculum for the biology and health professions majors is designed to give the student a strong 
background in the traditional areas of biology, there is parallel emphasis on molecular aspects since 
modern biology involves extensive study of the molecular and cellular level.  
There are several degrees offered within this program: the Master of Science in Healthcare 
Administration (a dual degree with JPU); the Master of Science in Integrative and Functional Medicine (a 
dual degree with JPU); the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Biology, the Bachelor of Arts and 
Bachelor of Science in Health Science, and the Bachelor of Science in Life Science Education; and the 
Bachelor of Science in Medical Imaging (a Grace College degree in partnership with JPU). Additionally, 
there is a minor in biology for those students in other majors desiring biology to accompany their 
chosen major. The Public Health Minor is also available in partnership with LCMC.  
Biology majors are required to minor in chemistry and to take supporting physics and math courses. The 
focus of the biology major at Grace is to prepare students for graduate work in many areas of biology 
including anatomy, biochemistry, botany, genetics, microbiology, physiology and zoology, as well as 
providing general preparation for a health professions graduate program. This major also prepares 
students for a general career in an area of biological science, including laboratory work in medicine or 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
 
Science and Mathematics    
  4 
June 2023 
 
chemistry, environmental careers, technical writing, pharmaceutical sales, or food science. Ecology and 
environmental biology have their own program of preparation at Grace.  
The health science major provides a solid foundation in the biological and physical sciences, and is 
specifically designed for the pre-professional preparation of students preparing credentials for 
admission into the professional programs of dentistry, medicine, optometry, pharmacy, physician 
assistant, physical therapy, veterinary medicine, and other health-related fields. Students should meet 
with the health professions advisor as early as possible in their studies at Grace to increase the 
probability of effective and accurate course selection and to understand other facets of preparing to be 
a successful applicant to their chosen graduate health professions program. 
 
Program Learning Outcomes

All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student.

The beautifully landscaped campus bustles with activity but also offers many quiet retreats. Numerous 
outdoor “friendship courts” provide seating areas, but students may also choose to enjoy a book under 
one of the many trees. Beautifully wooded walking trails inspire quiet reflection. The DOGC offices are 
located within the Department of Behavioral Sciences in Mount Memorial Hall.  
The Grace College campus is situated on 160 acres in the heart of historic Winona Lake. The evangelical 
heritage of Grace College is strongly rooted in this picturesque town. One will notice this as he or she tours 
historic sites such as the Billy Sunday Museum and the newly restored Westminster Hotel where a young 
Billy Graham was commissioned for a lifetime of Christian service. Winona Lake also is adjacent to Warsaw, 
which was previously named as one of the top 100 small towns in America.  
The Morgan Library offers quiet and group study spaces with access to print and electronic resources 
that support the curriculum.  Professional research assistance is available to help students access and 
navigate these resources. 
Athletic facilities include the Orthopedic Capital Center, six outdoor tennis courts, soccer fields, softball and 
baseball diamonds, and running trails. Grace’s Robert and Frances Gordon Student Recreation Center

houses basketball and volleyball courts, a 160-meter jogging track with a separate 50-meter straightaway, a 
weight training and fitness center, an aerobics room, offices, and a classroom, plus room for expansion. This 
is a perfect spot to relieve the tensions of a busy graduate schedule. 
Grace College Mission Statement                                                                                                         
Grace College is an evangelical Christian community of higher education which applies biblical values in 
strengthening character, sharpening competence, and preparing for service. 
DOGC Purpose Statement                                                                                                                           
The DOGC is committed to providing graduate level programming that equips students to be Scripturally 
grounded, professionally skilled, and interpersonally competent as they actively engage in the 
counseling profession and its related ministries. The purpose of the CMHC degree is to prepare students 
for future licensure in clinical mental health counseling.  
Programmatic Commitments                                                                                                                      
The graduate program offered by the DOGC is committed to the following goals as they relate to 
counselor education and supervision and/or counseling-related ministries: 
1. Scripturally Grounded: A commitment to Scripture as the foundation of truth in each course with a 
complimentary understanding of the truths is psychology and the social sciences. 
2. Professionally Skilled: A commitment to the professional and clinical development of the counselor-
in-training as an essential element for effective practice. 
3. Interpersonally Competent: A commitment to the interpersonal growth of the counselor-in-training 
as an essential element for effective practice. 
The DOGC’s purpose statement and programmatic commitments are reflected in the classroom, 
supervisory situations, and clinical settings. DOGC students receive a solid biblical foundation within each 
class curriculum. This theological education serves as an essential basis for understanding self, others, and 
God. DOGC students are equipped with a thorough understanding of counseling ethics, diagnosis, theory, 
and clinical issues, as well as trained to be professionally competent in clinical settings. DOGC students are 
also required to have sessions of professional counseling in an endeavor to wrestle with personal issues and 
more effectively understand and assist clients. 
Programmatic Assumptions                                                                                                                        
The CMHC program requires student adherence to both scriptural and professional codes related to the 
protection and preservation of human welfare and dignity.  DOGC students are therefore bound by the 
ethical standards for the practice of counseling as defined by the American Counseling Association (ACA) 
and the American Association of Christian Counselors (AACC).  When ethical principles vary between 
these two organizations, the DOGC will trend toward the most stringent ethical principle.  Further, 
DOGC students abide by the standards and expectations outlined in the Code of Conduct Policy section 
of this catalog.

The Department of Graduate Counseling (DOGC) is housed in the School of Behavioral Science and offers 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling

 June 2023 
 
the Master of Arts degree in Clinical Mental Health Counseling to graduate students who seek to 
become professional counselors.  This program of study is focused on promoting students’ personal, 
professional, and spiritual growth with a commitment to scripture as the foundation of truth and the 
basis for considering the truth found in psychological principles. The MA in CMHC is offered through an 
online platform.  
The DOGC program provides an opportunity for students to obtain a graduate degree in the counseling 
profession utilizing the flexibility of online education.  Students enrolled in the program receive support 
from the School of Professional and Online Education (SPOE) at Grace College. The DOGC’s program 
offers all of the CMHC courses virtually. Students enrolled in the online learning platform also attend 7-
day residencies or “intensives” each year at a designated location, typically the Grace College campus in 
Winona Lake, Indiana. This residency requirement allows students to benefit from face-to-face 
instruction, academic advising, and supervision from program faculty, and promotes critical relational 
interactions between faculty, students, and administrators that builds relationships and provides 
support to counterbalance the rigor and intensity of a graduate counseling program. The program offers 
graduate students an opportunity to earn a degree without relocating and may be especially appealing 
to individuals who want or need the flexibility of an online, non-resident program to meet their current 
commitments to family or job. 
 
Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling CACREP-Accredited Degree  
The M.A. CMHC degree is a 60-hour program for those entering the mental health counseling field 
and/or for those wanting to pursue their doctoral degree in counseling. The CMHC program prepares 
graduates to work as professional and clinical mental health counselors in a wide variety of settings by 
providing the learner with both didactic (in the classroom) and clinical (in the field) experiences 
throughout their schedule of study. The CMHC curriculum blends psychological and theological 
principles within each course in an effort to promote the development of each student’s clinical skills 
and Christian faith.    
IMPORTANT:  While the CMHC program is designed to meet the educational standards for licensure in 
the state of Indiana, graduating from the CMHC program does not guarantee licensure in the United 
States or any other country.  Students are responsible for understanding the particular laws and 
statutes governing licensure as a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), Licensed Professional 
Counselor (LPC), or equivalent in their state of residency post-graduation.  For more information about 
state licensure, please see the DOGC website and find the state licensure requirement document..   
Programmatic Accreditation                                                                                                                               
The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), which is a 
specialized accrediting body recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), has 
granted accreditation to the Grace College Department of Graduate Counseling for the M.A. in Clinical 
Mental Health Counseling degree. For more information on CACREP accreditation, please click here. 
IMPORTANT:  CACREP accreditation does not guarantee a student’s ability to obtain licensure as an 
LMHC, LPC, or equivalent in the United States or any other country.  Students are responsible for 
researching and understanding how CACREP impacts the practice of counseling and obtaining 
licensure in their desired state of residency post-graduation.

The DOGC develops and administers program policy and works with an advisory board that assists in 
reviewing program data and making recommendations for improvement. The board is comprised of 
up to ten (10) members including DOGC faculty, current students, program alumni, clinical site 
supervisors, and employers. The purpose of the advisory board is to engage with various stakeholders 
in program evaluation of the Department of Graduate Counseling. The advisory board meets semi-
annually or more often as required in order to review assessment data and program processes.  
Program Evaluation 
The DOGC develops and provides graduate level programming utilizing best practices for clinical 
counseling instruction and adhering to the CACREP standards of counselor education. The DOGC 
evaluates its program and policies on a continual basis using a variety of processes, including weekly 
faculty meetings, the self-study and peer-review CACREP accreditation process, engagement with 
various stakeholders through an established advisory board, and the analysis of quantitative and 
qualitative data gathered from student assessments. In addition to course evaluations and post-
residency evaluations, students in the DOGC program complete program evaluation assessments each 
Spring. This data is reviewed by DOGC faculty and the DOGC Advisory Board. The DOGC program may 
choose to make programmatic or policy changes using data gathered through these multiple 
assessment processes.  
Programmatic Changes Policy                                                                                                                    
The DOGC may choose to add or delete courses to schedules of study from time to time.  Students 
enrolled in a DOGC degree program over several years may be required to change their academic plan 
due to updated schedules of study or course changes.  Students will work with their individual advisors 
to ensure that they have met all requirements for graduation under the following stipulations: 
1. The original numerical requirements for course credit hours must remain the same as stated in the 
catalog under which the student entered into the program.  The program may not add to the credit 
hour requirement unless the student is in a remedial situation that is clearly documented. 
2. Students may not take more credit hours than required by their DOGC program schedule of study 
without written approval from the DOGC chair.  IMPORTANT:  Financial aid will not be available for 
courses taken outside of the student’s approved DOGC degree program. 
Course Availability Policy

Unclassified Students (nonclinical classes)                                                                                            
An individual who would like to take courses as an unclassified student must complete the 
Unclassified Student Application form and Professional  Reference form available 
online and from the Office of Graduate and Adult Enrollment. An unclassified student who desires to 
pursue a CMHC degree must complete and submit a full application to the School of Professional and 
Online Education.  
 An unclassified student is limited to a maximum of nine (9) credit hours and may register for any of the 
following courses: Theological Foundations of Counseling (CPY5050), Foundations of CMHC (CPY5100), 
Social and Cultural Issues (CPY6500), Personality and Counseling Theories (CPY5200), Research and 
Program Evaluation (CPY5592), Gender and Sexuality (CPY5750), or Ethical and Legal Issues (CPY6200).  
Unclassified students may not take courses other than those listed here.  Please note: courses are 
designed for students pursuing a clinical mental health counseling degree and those who wish to take 
CMHC courses as an unclassified student should be aware that if they do not have a background in 
behavioral science or counseling, they may not be successful in the course.  Students currently enrolled 
in the CMHC program are given first priority in registering for classes and therefore not all classes will 
have openings for unclassified students.

IMPORTANT: Individuals applying as unclassified students are not guaranteed acceptance into CMHC 
courses. An applicant who has been denied acceptance to the DOGC is not eligible to take courses in 
the DOGC as an unclassified student unless the admissions committee has given approval.   
Grace College Undergraduates Desiring to Take DOGC Courses 
1. Undergraduates may not take graduate courses for undergraduate credit. 
2. Undergraduates may take a limited number of graduate counseling classes for graduate credit 
as unclassified students. This credit cannot be applied to satisfy undergraduate requirements. 
3. Grace College seniors may apply to the DOGC as unclassified students in their final semester. 
These students may take up to 6 credits in the graduate counseling program as unclassified 
graduate students during their final semester. 
4. Students must have approval for graduate counseling courses from the DOGC Chair before 
registering for classes. Only unclassified courses may be taken by undergraduate seniors.  
5. Tuition charges will follow one of two options: 
a.) Block pricing will be applied for students who take 12 undergraduate credits with 
additional graduate credits. Under this option, students will qualify for full Grace financial 
aid. Students can take up to 6 graduate credits under block pricing. 
b.) Students taking fewer than 12 undergraduate credit hours will be charged according to 
the per credit hour tuition rate (1-11 credits) and could receive prorated Grace financial 
aid.  
This unclassified status does not guarantee acceptance into the graduate program. Students must 
go through the entire acceptance process and will be evaluated in exactly the same way as any 
other applicant. 
International Student Policy                                                                                                         
International Students who wish to take classes in the Department of Graduate Counseling should be 
aware that they must reside in the U.S. for the duration of all clinical courses. International applicants 
need to go through the normal procedure for admission to the DOGC. Applicants that do not speak 
English as a first language and have not attended an English-speaking undergraduate program should 
take the TOEFL exam or equivalent as determined by admissions and submit the scores to Admissions.  
Applicants with transcripts from non-U.S. undergraduate programs will be evaluated for equivalency to 
determine GPA. If GPA cannot be adequately determined, the applicant may not be admitted to the 
program or may be admitted conditionally until academic readiness can be clearly determined.  
U.S. Citizens Living Abroad 
Important: United States citizens living abroad may take didactic courses online. However, all fieldwork 
courses (Practicum, Internship, and Advanced Internship) must be completed at approved clinical sites 
within the United States or recognized United States military installations.  It is the student’s 
responsibility to identify potential clinical sites, submit sites for approval to the Clinical Coordinator, and 
make arrangements with site supervisors to complete administrative paperwork and develop a plan to 
meet course requirements.

Academic Policies Related to the DOGC Program                                                                         
Policies related to course enrollment, advising, appeals, graduation, and other academic requests and 
procedures are available in the Grace College Academic Policies Manual.  The following policies are 
supplemental to those found in the Grace College Academic Policies Manual. Students enrolled in the 
DOGC program are responsible for reading and understanding academic policies housed in both the 
Grace College and DOGC Catalogs. 
Grading Policy                                                                                                                                         
Students will be assigned a final grade or symbol (CR, NC, I) by the date published in the academic 
calendar each semester. The DOGC CMHC program utilizes the following grading scale to calculate 
grades and student GPA across courses within the CMHC curriculum (Pass/Fail or Credit/No-credit 
courses excluded): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1. The student’s grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of quality points 
earned in the DOGC by the total number of semester hours attempted (excluding courses 
bearing a grade of “W” and repeated courses).  
2. In several courses, a Credit/No Credit system is also used (See Credit/No Credit Policy for 
Counseling Skills and Practicum and Credit/No Credit Policy for Internship and Advanced 
Internship). 
3. An Incomplete (“I”) indicates the failure to complete a portion of a course’s requirements and 
may be assigned only in cases of serious illness or other emergency. The incomplete grade is 
considered temporary and students must make up the work without repeating the course. The 
incomplete grade must be replaced with a letter grade by the date specified by the professor, or 
it will become an “F” if not responded to within six (6) weeks after the close of the semester. 
4. At the end of each semester, students can visit the Portal on the Grace College website 
(www.grace.edu) to check their grades. When a final grade has been reported to the registrar, it 
cannot be changed except by the professor within the specified dates on the academic calendar. 
All indebtedness to the college must be satisfied before a transcript of record will be issued.

A student’s final grade can be changed only when an error was made in the calculation of the 
final grade or when the student has successfully completed the Academic Appeal and Review 
Process.  
a. This policy refers to requests for change of grade following the conclusion of a course.  
b. All grade changes must be submitted within 6 months and cannot be processed once the 
student’s degree has been certified.  
c. Grade changes must be requested by the faculty of record using the Grade Change Form 
available in the Registrar’s Office. 
Academic Status Policy (please see Academic Professional Retention Policy)                                     
Students matriculating in the DOGC program must successfully complete all courses with a grade of “B” 
(83%) or higher and a GPA of 3.0. in order to graduate from the program. Grades of “B-” or below are 
considered failing; and the student must successfully repeat these courses the next time the course is 
offered.   
Course grades of B- or below are considered “Failing” and indicate that the student is not progressing 
satisfactorily, and attention must be paid to academic or other issues related to the student’s 
achievement. Students who fall below a 3.0 GPA in one term will be placed on Academic Probation. 
Students who receive a B- or below in a course will receive a Professional Development Notification 
(PDN). If a student receives 2 PDNs, then he or she is referred to the Student Professional Development 
Committee (SPDC).  Each student’s academic status is determined at the end of every term based on the 
following criteria:   
1. Regular Academic Status – Students who earn grades “B” (83%) or higher in their DOGC 
coursework, maintain a 3.0 GPA, and receive satisfactory faculty evaluations will be considered on 
Regular Academic Status.  This status allows DOGC students to continue matriculating in their 
degree program without restriction.   
2. Academic Probation – Students who receive a grade of “B- “or below or a No Credit in Counseling 
Skills, Practicum, Internship, or Advanced Internship courses and/or fall below a 3.0 Term GPA will 
be placed on Academic Probation following the term in which either of these occurred. Students on 
Academic Probation must meet with their academic advisor to discuss remediating academic 
deficiencies. Students on Academic Probation must successfully pass with a “B” or higher all courses 
within the next term and earn a 3.0 term GPA in order to return to Regular Academic Status.  
3. Academic Dismissal – Students who earn two grades of “B- “or below, earn a grade of No Credit 
twice in Counseling Skills, Practicum, Internship, or Advanced Internship courses, or exhibit 
professional, ethical, or other interpersonal concerns that may affect their academic grades will be 
referred to the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC). The SPDC will review the 
student’s progress in the program and professional counseling competencies for determination of 
remediation or dismissal.   
Full Time & Part Time Status                                                                                                                       
For the 2023-2025 academic years, students enrolled in a minimum of six (6) credit hours of CMHC 
coursework in a given semester are considered “full-time” and eligible for financial aid as such. Students 
enrolled in a minimum of three (3) credit hours of CMHC coursework in a given semester are considered 
“part-time” and eligible for financial aid as such.  Additional questions related to financial aid, including

but not limited to, when financial monies are given out each year, can be directed to the Grace College 
Financial Aid office at 1-800-544-7223, ext. 6162. 
Attendance Policy                                                                                                                                   
Because classroom discussions and activities are collaborative and essential to the learning of counseling 
competencies, it is critical that students attend every class. It is the policy of the DOGC that absences 
due to illness (verified by a doctor’s note) or death of a family member are excused absences. Most 
other absences are not excused. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor in advance 
and obtain approval prior to missing a class or course requirement. If an emergency arises which makes 
advance notice of absence impossible, students are expected to notify the instructor by email, text, or 
phone call as soon as reasonably possible.   
Attendance in all DOGC courses includes the student’s presence and active participation in classroom 
sessions. Attendance and participation include the use of operable web-cameras, integrated 
microphone headsets, as well as participating in the synchronous and asynchronous classroom activities 
and discussions. All courses have a minimum requirement for synchronous classroom meetings. 
 
Non-Clinical Courses 
Faculty members determine the attendance policies in courses for which they are responsible, provide 
students with information describing their attendance policies, and determine the penalty for students 
who fail to attend class according to these stated policies. 
1. Students are expected to attend faithfully every course in which they are enrolled. 
2. Students should consult the attendance policy of the professor of record to determine policies, 
responsibilities, and penalties for excused and unexcused absences for individual courses. 
Clinical Courses 
Attendance at clinical sites and faculty and site supervision is mandatory. Any unexcused absence may 
result in a “No Credit” for the course. 
Residency 
Students are required to attend and earn a Credit for Residency each year they are enrolled and actively 
taking classes in the CMHC program. In extreme circumstances, students who can’t attend Residency 
due to health concerns, death in the family, or other matters that would cause extreme hardship for the 
student may apply for a waiver, first through their advisor, then to the DOGC Department Chair. The 
decision rendered by the Chair will be final. If a waiver is granted, the student may be able to take 
didactic courses in the next academic year but may not take clinical courses. 
 
Practicum and Internship Orientations 
Students taking clinical classes must be adequately prepared for working in the field. Therefore, all 
Orientation meetings for Practicum and Internship are considered mandatory. Students who do not 
attend these meetings will be given remedial work as determined by the Clinical Coordinator to acquire 
the information needed to work in the field.  Students who do not complete the remedial work will not 
be allowed to work at a clinical site until the remedial work has been completed.   
 
Additional Academic Requirements 
Orientation to Clinical Mental Health Counseling 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 18 
 June 2023 
 
The Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP) is the primary 
accreditor for the Grace College Clinical Mental Health Counseling program.  CACREP standards require 
all students entering the CMHC program to have a new student orientation prior to or at the beginning 
of the first term they are registered for classes. For this reason, all students must complete CPY5005 
Orientation to CMHC prior to or concurrently with courses taken in their first session in the program. 
Students who do not receive a Credit for this course may not register for subsequent courses until this 
program requirement is met.    
 
Degree Audit Form 
Students are required to meet with their academic advisors prior to or within the first few weeks of their 
first session in the CMHC program to complete and sign a Degree Audit Form. This form is written 
documentation of the student’s schedule of study and outlines the student’s expected progression 
through the CMHC program. For this reason, students who have not completed this requirement are not 
allowed to continue or register for courses past the first session of the program.  In addition, all students 
are required to meet with their advisors annually to review and submit an updated Degree Audit Form.   
 
Academic Advising 
Upon acceptance to the CMHC program, each student is assigned a faculty advisor who will remain the 
students’ academic advisor throughout the entire program unless otherwise notified.  Academic 
advisors serve as the student’s first source of information related to understanding program policies and 
procedures. Additionally, the advisor serves as a mentor in discussing course progression and sharing 
celebrations and concerns that the student experiences during their program.  During times when a 
student has difficulty meeting an academic or behavioral competency, as outlined in the DOGC Catalog’s 
Academic and Professional Retention Policy, or receives a Notice of Concern (NOC) or Professional 
Development Notification (PDN), the advisor acts as a coach to assist the student in remediating 
identified concerns. Advisors also act as an accountability source when a student experiences difficulty 
meeting academic or professional competencies and needs assistance. In these situations, the student 
should contact their advisor for help in formulating a plan that enhances the student’s success in the 
program.  
 
If a student receives a Professional Development Notification (PDN), the person issuing the PDN will 
include a specific plan for remediation.  The student and their advisor will review the plan and may add 
additional objectives and interventions to assist the student in meeting the competency goals. The 
student’s advisor is responsible for monitoring the remediation plan with the student, communicating 
with the student that the student is passing, failing, or has failed to reach desired improvements, and for 
imposing the specific consequences identified in the plan. The student’s advisor will also communicate 
with the person who issued the PDN. Failure to complete a remediation plan will result in referral to the 
SPDC Committee.  
 
When a student receives a Notice of Concern or experiences difficulty in meeting academic or 
professional competencies, the student should work to develop a plan to enhance the students’ success 
in the program.  The student’s advisor is available to consult with the student in creation of this plan and 
can serve as an accountability source for the student.  The collaborative plan for success should (a) 
communicate specific desired improvements, (b) actions the student will take to meet these goals, (c) 
specific dates for follow-up and review with the advisor, and (d) identify the consequences for failing to 
reach the student’s desired goals.

To register for the first semester of study, students will work with the School of Professional and Online 
Education and their advisor. Subsequent registration for courses will be completed by DOGC students 
through the Grace College Portal.   
Statement on Disabilities                                                                                                                             
A student with a documented disability is entitled by law to accommodations for the disability. 
Accommodations provide students with disabilities an equal opportunity to be successful by reducing or 
removing the barriers that may be caused by a disability and a traditional academic environment. Grace 
College seeks to provide reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities (e.g., 
attention, health, hearing, learning, mobility, physical, psychiatric, or vision).  Students with a 
documented disability or special learning need should contact Connie Burkholder, Coordinator of 
Student Disability Services at x6423, via email at burkhoc@grace.edu or stop by the Learning Center, 
located in Morgan library, for assistance. Students with a disability will be assisted by the Learning 
Center in requesting approved accommodations in their courses.  Adequate time must be allowed to 
arrange accommodations and accommodations are not retroactive; therefore, students with disabilities 
should contact the Coordinator as soon as possible in the session for which they are seeking 
accommodations. The law states that college personnel, including field instructors, cannot ask a student 
if he/she has a disability. Therefore, if a student would like accommodations for any classes, it is the 
student’s responsibility to inform their course instructors of any approved accommodations.  Although 
reasonable attempts will be made to accommodate students in off-campus learning environments, 
Grace College is unable to guarantee that every off-campus environment will be able to offer the 
accommodations that students request. In the cases in which there is a required off-campus experience, 
the DOGC will work with the Disability Office and the student to determine what accommodations are 
available for fulfilling the educational requirements.  
Readmission                                                                                                                                       
Individuals who want to be readmitted to the DOGC are defined as former students of DOGC who wish 
to reapply to the institution. The following is a list of readmission categories: 
• 
Following Voluntary Withdrawal - Students who have voluntarily withdrawn from the DOGC may 
apply for re-admission through the regular application process.  Students who have voluntarily 
withdrawn are not guaranteed readmission to the DOGC program. 
• 
Following Dismissal by SPDC - Students who have been dismissed from the program are eligible to 
reapply for admission after two years from the date of dismissal, through the regular application 
process. Students who have been issued a programmatic dismissal are not guaranteed readmission 
to the DOGC program. 
IMPORTANT: Students who are readmitted into the DOGC program may be required to retake certain 
classes depending on the length of time out of the program, changes in programmatic curriculum, and 
developments in the counseling field.  Decisions regarding readmission are made by the DOGC 
Admissions Committee and/or DOGC Chair on a case by case basis.  Students are notified in writing of 
the decision made regarding their readmission.  Readmitted students are subject to these decisions 
without appeal. 
Second Degree Completion

Students who would like to obtain a second master’s degree at Grace must complete a minimum of 50% 
of the second degree at Grace without any course substitutions in either the first or second master’s 
degree. Thus, no more than 50% of a given degree may count toward another degree. 
Transfer Credits Policy                                                                                                                          
Students accepted into the CMHC program may apply for transfer credit of a maximum of four (4) 
graduate level counseling courses (12 credit hours) from a CACREP accredited program to be applied 
towards the completion of their CMHC degree.  Only graduate counseling courses completed prior to 
admission into the DOGC program, and within the last five (5) years with a grade of “B” or higher, are 
eligible for transfer consideration.  Students applying for transfer credit must complete the Application 
for Course Transfer Credit Form and submit this form to the Department Chair.  Students will be 
required to submit official transcripts and course syllabi to determine the equitability of the course(s) 
previously taken with the current CMHC curriculum.  Clinical coursework (Practicum, Internship, and 
Advanced Internship) may not be satisfied through transfer credit.  Courses taken subsequent to 
admission to the CMHC program are not eligible for transfer.  All transfer credit paperwork must be 
submitted and approved before the end of the student’s first 8-week session at Grace 
College.  Decisions regarding course transfer are made by the Department of Graduate Counseling Chair 
on a case by case basis.  Students are notified in writing of the decision made regarding their transfer 
credits.  The Registrar’s Office will be notified of all transfer approvals by the DOGC.  
Degree Completion Policy                                                                                          
Students enrolled in the DOGC program are allowed seven (7) years from the beginning of their 
coursework to complete all degree requirements.  Students may be asked to repeat clinical courses 
(Counseling Skills, Practicum, Internship, or Advanced Internship) that were taken more than five years 
prior to completing the CMHC curriculum at the discretion of the Department Chair.   
Withdrawal Policy 
1. Course Withdrawal  
Students can add or drop courses during the allotted add/drop window each semester as 
determined by the Grace College Registrar’s Office.  Students who wish to drop a graduate course 
from their schedule of study outside of the allotted add/drop window must complete the Course 
Withdrawal form and submit this form to their academic advisor.   
IMPORTANT: Students who take a course Withdrawal are responsible for understanding the 
ramifications of such a decision on their financial aid, loan repayment plan, and expected graduation 
date. Please note that dates after which refunds are allowed and when an “F” is placed on the transcript 
rather than a “W” is determined by the Business and Registrar’s offices and students will need to work 
with these departments to ensure they have the needed information.  In the case of extenuating or 
unforeseen circumstances, such as a death in the family or serious health issue, students may petition 
the Department Chair, in writing, for a Late Withdrawal prior to the conclusion of the course, which if 
granted would allow the student to earn a “W” instead of a failing grade. Petitions are not always 
granted. Students who fail a course once may retake the course and if a passing grade is earned, the F 
will not appear on the transcript. It is highly recommended that students contact the Financial Aid 
office prior to withdrawal to discuss how these policies will impact them.

2. Continuous Enrollment 
Students accepted into the CMHC program are encouraged to maintain continuous enrollment. This 
means students remain active by completing a minimum of one course per semester. When a 
student chooses to take a break or temporarily withdraw from courses, Grace College and DOGC 
program policies are automatically initiated. For the purpose of financial aid and accounting, a 
student not enrolled in at least one course is viewed by Grace College to have withdrawn from the 
school. The student will be responsible for any financial accounts and may be placed in a payback 
status for Financial Aid. Students who temporarily withdraw from the program for a full academic 
year will be required to update their information with the Admissions Department and contact their 
advisor prior to returning to the program.  Students wishing to return to the CMHC program after a 
temporary withdrawal of more than one academic year must complete the application process and 
may be required to retake certain classes depending on the length of time out of the program, 
changes in programmatic curriculum, and developments in the counseling field.   
3. Temporary Withdrawal 
A student who considers not enrolling in classes should work with their advisor to discuss options 
and review consequences of a temporary withdrawal. If the student decides not to enroll in courses, 
they must submit a Temporary Withdrawal application to their advisor.  Courses taken outside the 
DOGC program during Temporary Withdrawal are not eligible for transfer credit. Students are 
required to attend Residency each year they are enrolled and actively taking classes within the 
CMHC program. Students who take a Temporary Withdrawal are strongly encouraged to attend 
scheduled Residencies in order to register for courses upon their return. 
IMPORTANT: Students who take a Temporary Withdrawal are responsible for understanding the 
ramifications of such a decision on their schedule of study and expected graduation date.  It is 
highly recommended that students work with their advisor prior to withdrawal to discuss how 
this will impact them. 
4. Voluntary Programmatic Withdrawal 
Students who wish to withdraw from the DOGC must complete a Programmatic Withdrawal 
application and submit this form to their academic advisor.  Students who have been granted a 
programmatic withdrawal must reapply for admission into the DOGC program as per the regular 
application process outlined here.     
IMPORTANT: Students who take a Programmatic Withdrawal are responsible for understanding 
the ramifications of such a decision on their Financial Aid and loan repayment plan.  It is highly 
recommended that students contact the Financial Aid Office prior to withdrawal to discuss how 
this will impact them. 
5. Programmatic Dismissal 
In circumstances when the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC) has determined 
that a student will be dismissed from the program, the dismissal will be immediate, and the student 
will not be permitted to return to currently enrolled courses or complete further coursework. When 
students are dismissed from clinical courses, the SPDC will work with the student and clinical 
supervisor to provide an ethical and professional transition of the student’s client caseload. When 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling

students are dismissed from the program, an “F “or No Credit (NCR) will be recorded on their 
transcripts for all current courses.  SPDC will notify OIT to deactivate student’s access to Grace 
College email and other services.    
Students who have been dismissed from the program are eligible to reapply for admission to the 
CMHC program after two years from the date of dismissal, through the regular application process. 
Students who have been issued a programmatic dismissal are not guaranteed readmission to the 
program. 
IMPORTANT: Students who are dismissed from the program are responsible for understanding the 
ramifications of such a decision on their financial aid, loan repayment plan, and campus email 
access.  Please note: students are responsible for contacting the business office regarding any 
tuition refunds.   
Recording of Lectures                                                                                                                                   
No audio or video recordings of any class session may be made without securing prior permission from 
the professor. The professor may legitimately choose not to allow such recordings. When permission is 
granted, it is understood that the recording is to be used only by the student(s) registered in the course 
involved. No public use or reduplication is permitted. The recording of one class, or several classes, or 
portions of classes, when an excused absence is absolutely necessary, may be permitted, but such 
recordings should not be collected or preserved for other uses. When recording is helpful for a student 
attending the course to assist with certain disabilities, it is understood that the recordings are not to be 
collected or preserved for later use after the course. Some professors will not permit individual 
recording but may lend prepared recordings for use in case of emergency absences. These may not be 
duplicated. In no case may a student record, or have recorded, an entire course or a major portion of a 
course in lieu of attending classes or as a way to solve the problem of schedule conflicts without 
permission of the DOGC Department Chair. 
Graduation Policy

Faculty Evaluation of Student Dispositions 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 23 
 June 2023 
 
Following each course, faculty review each student’s dispositions within that course, using standards 
outlined in the Counseling Program Retention Criteria. Student dispositions are rated on a 1 to 4 scale, 
with a rating of 3 indicating target performance. Instructors who score a student below a 3 in any 
category must have made previous formal contact with that student concerning this issue. In these 
situations, formal contact is expected to include a Notice of Concern, Professional Development 
Notification, an email outlining concerns, or a face-to-face meeting with the student documenting the 
instructor’s concern. Each year, every student receives a letter from the DOGC summarizing their 
performance in dispositional areas. 
Student Self-Evaluation of Dispositions 
Each year, all students in the DOGC program are required to complete the Student Self-Assessment of 
Professional Counseling Dispositions.  This quantitative and qualitative assessment is reviewed by the 
student’s advisor and each student is encouraged to discuss any concerns or questions with their 
academic advisor.  
Data is collected from the student self-assessments, both quantitative and qualitative, and themes are 
derived from responses. This collective data is reviewed by the DOGC faculty, and may be shared with 
the DOGC advisory board, for the purpose of evaluating and improving the program.   
Additional Graduation Application Criteria 
In addition, students enrolled in the DOGC program must abide by the following as it relates to 
graduation from the program:  
1. Students enrolled in the DOGC program must have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 to be eligible for 
graduation. 
2. CMHC students must have registered for and passed Candidacy. 
3. CMHC students must register for and pass the Comprehensive Exam and Portfolio requirement of 
their program before they are eligible for graduation. Degrees will be conferred upon verification 
that (a) the Comprehensive Exam has been taken and passed and (b) the Portfolio requirements 
have been successfully met in addition to the other requirements of the program.   
4. CMHC students must be enrolled in Advanced Internship and be on-target to complete all required 
hours before they are eligible to apply for graduation.   
5. Any student intending to graduate from the DOGC within an academic year is required to 
complete an "Application for Graduation" and submit it to the Registrar's office within the time 
frame given.  The Registrar will forward a copy of the application to the DOGC.  
6. Graduation audits will be completed by the Registrar to verify students are in compliance with 
graduation degree requirements. 
7. Payment of all debts, encumbrances, fees, etc., must be cared for by the student in order to receive 
his or her diploma/degree. For loan borrowers, this may also include an online exit counseling 
requirement.  Specific information is available at the Financial Aid Office.

IMPORTANT:  Graduate students should consult their academic advisor for specific graduation 
information pertaining to their degree program. 
Critical Competencies for CMHC Students                                                                                    
Students enrolled in the CMHC program must demonstrate attainment of critical competencies related 
to theological, interpersonal, and clinical development as part of professional gatekeeping and satisfying 
the requirements for this degree.  In addition to passing academic and field courses, students must 
receive a passing score or “Credit” grade (as determined by the DOGC faculty) in each of the following 
competency assessment probes:       
1. Candidacy Requirements  
Candidacy is the gatekeeping process by which the DOGC faculty determines student readiness for 
advancement from didactic coursework into clinical work. Students must register for Candidacy 
following successful completion of the CPY 5700 Practicum course.  Candidacy is a “Pass/Fail” 
component of the CMHC degree.  Students passing Candidacy can proceed into the final clinical 
phase of the CMHC program (Internship and Advanced Internship). Students who do not pass 
Candidacy cannot proceed into Internship and will be referred to the Student Professional 
Development Committee (SPDC). Students who fail Candidacy may reapply for Candidacy once 
they have been given approval by the SPDC. Students who fail Candidacy twice will be 
dismissed from the CMHC program.  
A requirement of Candidacy is that each student must complete four counseling sessions with a 
licensed counselor. The personal counseling verification form must be submitted as part of 
Candidacy. In keeping with the program philosophy, personal counseling is required to process 
personal issues that often surface as a result of self-reflection, increased self-awareness, 
transference-countertransference, and working with clients whose presenting problems or 
personal characteristics trigger students’ own issues. The Department of Graduate Counseling 
can help provide the student with a referral list of counselors.  The student should be aware 
that this component might involve an additional expense. 
2. Comprehensive Exam  
The Comprehensive Exam is one of three gatekeeping processes (along with Candidacy and 
Portfolio) by which the DOGC faculty assesses student readiness to graduate from the CMHC 
program.  The Comprehensive Exam utilizes the standardized Counselor Preparation 
Comprehensive Examination (CPCE), administered by the National Board for Certified 
Counselors.  Students must make arrangements to take the CPCE through an approved testing 
site. Students should keep in mind the timing required for registration, completing the exam, 
and having scores sent to Grace College. CPCE scores must be received at least 30 days prior to 
the expected graduation date. Students will be required to pay for the test through the 
approved testing site. The Comprehensive Exam tests the student’s proficiency in the following 
eight major areas: Professional Counseling Orientation and Ethical Practice, Social and Cultural 
Diversity, Human Growth and Development; Career Development, Counseling and Helping 
Relationships; Social and Cultural Foundations; Group Counseling and Group Work; Assessment 
and Testing, and Research and Program Evaluation.  The CPCE is a “Pass/Fail” exam. The 
Department of Graduate Counseling, using the CPCE national norms, determines the minimum 
passing score. Students who earn the minimum passing score or higher are eligible to graduate 
from the CMHC program.  Students who score below the minimum passing score must re-take 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 25 
 June 2023 
 
the CPCE and receive a passing score in order to graduate.  If a student has not achieved a 
passing score after taking the CPCE three times but has shown competency in all areas covered 
by the exam, the student should meet with their advisor and the Department Chair to assess 
alternative methods of meeting the comprehensive exam requirement.  Please click here for 
more information on the CPCE. 
3. Portfolio 
Portfolio is one of three gatekeeping processes (along with the Comprehensive Exam) by which 
the DOGC faculty determines student readiness to graduate from the CMHC program.  Students 
must register to present their Portfolio prior to graduation during the Advanced Internship 
course. In addition to completing all Portfolio requirements, students must present a 
professional identity oral presentation Portfolio is a “Pass/Fail” component of the CMHC degree.  
Students receiving a passing grade will be eligible for graduation from the CMHC program.  
Students receiving a failing grade are not eligible for graduation.  Students who fail Portfolio will 
be required to complete remedial work as designated by faculty. If a student fails Portfolio twice 
but has shown competency in all areas of the Portfolio assessment otherwise, the student 
should meet with their advisor and the department chair to assess alternative methods of 
meeting the Portfolio requirement. Graduation will be postponed until Portfolio has been 
passed.  
Additional Policies Related to the DOGC 
Acknowledgement of Catalog Policy                                                                                                
Students are required to read the DOGC Catalog and submit a completed Acknowledgement of the 
DOGC Catalog Form to their advisor each academic year. The catalog is reviewed and updated bi-
annually. In unusual circumstances, it may be modified mid-year, and these modifications will be posted 
as addendums. It is the responsibility of the student to review the catalog periodically in order to remain 
current with its contents. 
Dissemination of Program Information                                                                                       
Information is disseminated to students in DOGC programs via the Grace College email system.  Active 
students enrolled in the DOGC program will be given a personalized Grace College email 
account.  Students are responsible for checking their personal Grace College email account on a regular 
basis (daily is advisable).  It is not advised that students set up automatic email forwarding from their 
Grace College account to a personal email account, as certain emails may be blocked and/or identified 
as spam. In addition, program information can be found on the Resource page on the portal, on the 
Department of Graduate Counseling website, and in Canvas course shells.   
Counseling Services                                                                                                       
 A DOGC student who would like to obtain counseling is encouraged to do so. Students who observe 
others in need of assistance are urged to support the student in need by referring them to a counselor. 
The Grace College Counseling Center, located in the Gordon Recreation Center, provides counseling 
services to a limited number of graduate students in Indiana. Telehealth appointments are available as 
well. For an appointment, call the Grace College Counseling Center counselor, (574) 372-5100, ext. 6468.

In a very broad sense, DOGC students will need a computer purchased in the last couple of years, a high-
speed internet connection, a web browser, anti-malware software, and the Microsoft Office Suite of 
programs.  Depending on the academic program, additional equipment (such as a recording device) and 
services (such as Time2Track) may be a required purchase.  In addition, computer literacy is required 
along with skills that go beyond word processing in the areas of hardware and software installation.   
Prospective students may access the technology and computer literacy requirements on the Office of 
Information Technology page of the Grace College Website. This information includes a chart detailing 
the specific hardware and software requirements and recommendations. At the end of the chart are 
some suggested computers students may purchase that will meet Grace College’s requirements. 
Please note: Mobile phones and tablets are not allowed for recording client sessions or volunteer 
role-plays.  These devices are not secure and are not suitable for keeping client information 
confidential.  
 
Technology Requirements for Online Courses                                                                                       
The Office of Instructional Technology and the office of Student and Professional Online Education will 
work with students related to important information concerning technology for the virtual/online 
classroom.  Because of their very nature, the success of online courses is dependent not only on the 
quality of the technology used, but also the skill set of the individual using the technology.

obligation to endorse a student or write letters of recommendation. 
Professional Organizations                                                                                                                 
The DOGC acknowledges the importance of counseling students development of a professional 
counseling identity through membership and participation in professional counseling organizations. To 
facilitate this process, all students are required to join a professional counseling organization by the end 
of the first year of their schedule of study. Students may enroll in national counseling organizations such 
as the American Counseling Association (ACA) or the American Mental Health Counseling Association 
(AMHCA), or students may elect membership in their state or other regional professional counseling 
organization. Students are required to participate in their chosen professional counseling organization 
for a minimum of three (3) hours per year. This participation may include attending or presenting at 
conferences, serving on student committees, volunteering, or other professional involvement. Students 
must submit evidence of their membership and participation in a professional counseling organization 
to their advisors each year in order to be eligible to register for courses.   
License  
Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC) or Licensed Professional Counselor 
(LPC)                                                                                                                   
Persons interested in licensing should check with the state licensing board for the state in which 
licensing will be pursued. In Indiana, this license requires a 60-hour master’s degree in counseling from 
an accredited college or university. In addition, the candidate must complete a designated number of 
supervised counseling hours under a licensed counselor or psychologist and pass a qualifying 
examination. For more information about Indiana licensure, please consult the Indiana Professional 
Licensing Agency website.  
All states accept the education of applicants for licensure from a CACREP-approved program. However, a 
few states require additional coursework. The DOGC webpage maintains information on state 
requirements for licensure. It is important that students check the licensing boards/agencies of their 
state for detailed requirements.  If a student becomes a licensed mental health counselor, continuing 
education credit hours are necessary on a yearly basis to maintain licensure.

• 
Financial Aid Policies 
Students interested in further information about the financial aid application process, financial aid 
award notices, financial aid eligibility and appeals, satisfactory academic progress, and financial aid 
suspension should contact the Office of Student Financial Aid Services. 
• 
Refunds  
Tuition refunds for students withdrawing or dropping a class will be based on the official date of 
that action.  A student withdrawing from the school must contact the DOGC to complete the 
appropriate forms.  A student dropping from a class must contact the DOGC to complete the drop.   
Withdrawal from the school or dropping a class can change financial aid.  It is the student’s 
responsibility to contact the Financial Aid office and the Business Office to ascertain the effect of 
the action and make payment if needed. 
Satisfactory Academic Progress                                                                                                     
Recipients of student financial assistance are required to make satisfactory academic progress toward 
a specific educational objective or degree. The federal government's Department of Education has 
mandated that Grace College monitor and enforce these standards which are consistent with the 
educational mission of the college. This policy applies to all students receiving assistance from any 
financial aid program administered by the Office of Financial Aid at Grace College.  This policy is 
administered separately from the college's academic probation and suspension policy.  
Qualitative and Quantitative Measure 
Satisfactory academic progress is measured by both a qualitative and a quantitative standard.  The 
qualitative standard is based on meeting the minimum cumulative GPA required for the number of 
hours attempted.  The quantitative standard requires the student to have completed the required 
minimum percentage for the number of hours attempted.  The Office of Financial Aid determines on an 
annual basis (at the end of spring semester) the eligibility of the student for continued financial aid 
based on the standards established under the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy.   
GRADUATE LEVEL: 
Hours 
Attempted 
Minimum % 
Of Completion 
Minimum 
Cum. GPA 
All (1+) 
67% 
2.000 
Students who fail to complete the required minimum percentage of credit hours as listed above and/or 
who do not meet the minimum grade point requirements during any applicable academic year will be 
cited as not making satisfactory academic progress.  Students who fail to meet the standards at the end 
of the spring semester each academic year will be placed on financial aid suspension and notified in 
writing.  Students placed on suspension are not eligible for financial aid funding. 
Courses for which a student receives F, W, or I will count as credits attempted but will not be considered 
as credits successfully completed.  Incompletes will be considered as successful completions if the I is 
changed to a grade (other than F or W) within the six-week period granted by the Academic Policy 
Manual.  Courses that are repeated for academic forgiveness will count in the number of credits 
attempted and completed.  If the original course had a passing grade, the original credits are counted as

completed even though the grade is no longer calculated as part of the cumulative GPA.  Courses for 
which a student receives CR count towards credits attempted and completed even if the grade is not 
calculated as part of the cumulative GPA.  Courses for which a student receives NCR count toward the 
credits attempted but not completed. Courses which are taken for credit, even though they are remedial 
in nature, are counted in both the quantitative and qualitative computations for eligibility. AU (Audit) 
credits do not count either in the cumulative GPA or in the credit hours attempted/completed.  
Eligibility and Appeal Process 
A student who has lost eligibility for financial aid may take courses at Grace College at their own 
expense until they have achieved the required minimum cumulative GPA and/or the required minimum 
number of credit hours.  Once completing these requirements, the student must request that SAP be 
reviewed again if requirements are completed at the end of Fall or Summer terms. Financial aid will be 
reinstated if the student has been found to be meeting the SAP requirements. 
A student who has been denied financial aid can appeal by contacting the Registrar to develop an 
Academic Plan that will enable the student to regain SAP by the end of a year. A student has 30 days 
from the date of the notification of suspension to develop the Academic Plan and submit it to the Office 
of Financial Aid.  The Academic Plan needs to spell out when and how SAP will be achieved. The 
Academic Plan will grant one year of SAP Probation. If the student is not meeting this prescribed plan 
when SAP is reviewed again at the end of the spring term, the student will be placed on Financial Aid 
Suspension until SAP has been achieved and there will not be another probationary period. 
If a student cannot develop a satisfactory academic plan with the registrar that will resolve their SAP 
failure by the end of a year, the student will have to pay for courses at their own expense. 
Student Rights and Responsibilities                                                                                                          
All students enrolled in the DOGC program assume an obligation to conduct themselves at all times as 
responsible members of the Grace College community, to respect the personal and property rights of 
others, and to support the educational mission of Grace College.  Grace College and the DOGC insist that 
its students demonstrate personal and professional integrity in addition to academic excellence. Grace 
College administrators, faculty, and staff encourage student involvement in decision making. Student 
membership and input on institutional committees are valued and encouraged at Grace College. 
Attitude and Conduct Expectations                                                                                                  
Members of the Grace College community are committed to the mission of the institution and to living 
in a manner that brings glory to the name of our Lord. All students enrolled in the DOGC program are 
required to uphold the standards of the Grace College community and affirm their agreement to do so 
by signing a Statement on Community Lifestyle Expectations. A copy of this document can be found on 
the Department of Graduate Counseling Resource page on the portal.   
In addition to following the Grace College community lifestyle expectations, students also are required 
to adhere to the Code of Conduct Policy outlined below:  
Code of Conduct Policy

• 
Violation of the ethical codes (ACA & AACC) and/or state licensing laws and statutes governing and 
pertaining to the counseling profession. 
 
If a professor believes that a student is violating any of the above guidelines, the offending parties will 
be contacted directly in an effort to discuss the situation. Based on the severity of the violation and/or 
the student’s receptivity to the instructor’s intervention, the professor reserves the right to implement 
remediation of issues related to the offense.  Offenses that violate policies and procedures outlined in 
the Graduate Counseling program catalog or the professional ethics and standards published by the 
American Counseling Association may result in a failing grade or a “No Credit” for the course.  
If a student feels that another student is behaving inappropriately, they are advised to follow the 
principles outlined in Matthew 18 and discuss this concern with the other student. If for some reason, 
the student does not feel they can do this, the student is advised to send a private email to the 
professor explaining the situation to discuss a wise course of action as soon as possible. 
The DOGC reserves the right to discipline or dismiss a student who, in its judgment, does not conform 
either to the stated regulations governing conduct or to the expressed principles, policies, and programs 
of Grace College.  By virtue of their enrollment in the DOGC program, students agree to live within the 
framework of these standards.  Students suspected of violating either the institutional or programmatic 
Code of Conduct will be referred to the SPDC. Students found guilty of violating either Code of Conduct 
are subject to sanctions up to and including dismissal from Grace College. Disciplinary problems will be 
handled by the Dean of the School of Behavioral Sciences and the Chair of the DOGC in conjunction with 
the Vice President of Student Affairs and Academic Services. Students found guilty of violating the Code 
of Conduct Policy, even a first offense, shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including 
dismissal from Grace College.

Student Concerns Regarding the Faculty Instructor                                                                                                           
If the student has concerns or conflict with the faculty instructor, they should first approach the 
professor and attempt to resolve the stated concerns in a one-on-one meeting. If the student feels that 
the concerns are not addressed or resolved after meeting with the instructor, the student should 
contact their advisor to discuss further recourse options.  If the student’s concerns are regarding a 
perceived ethical or moral violation on the part of the faculty instructor and the student does not feel 
comfortable discussing this with the professor, the student is advised to discuss this with the 
Department of Graduate Counseling Chair. 
Requesting Additional Evaluation by Professionals                                                                                                 
Referral for mandatory evaluation is the purview of the Dean of Behavioral Sciences. The Dean may 
require a student to submit to an evaluation by a health care professional in limited circumstances (such 
as where violence or suicide is threatened and where drug or alcohol abuse is suspected). In such cases, 
the evaluation is to determine and protect the health and safety of the student, the campus, and/or 
clinical site during practicum and internship courses.   
Academic Dishonesty/Plagiarism 
Academic Integrity                                                                                                                                         
Grace College and Seminary is committed to fostering students’ intellectual, moral, and spiritual 
development.  Academic dishonesty—in all forms—is a serious violation of academic integrity, Grace’s 
community standards for scholarship and behavior, and Christian morality.  Because academic integrity 
is an important value of Grace College and Seminary, violations of the Academic Integrity Policy may 
result in severe academic penalties and/or disciplinary consequences. 
• 
Students are expected to uphold high standards of academic integrity and refrain from committing 
or facilitating acts of academic dishonesty.  Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, 
cheating, plagiarizing, falsifying or fabricating data, stealing or interfering with another student’s 
work, and submitting substantial portions of the same work for more than one course without prior 
consent from the instructor. 
• 
All submitted work is accepted as a student’s own work, unless otherwise understood and 
approved by the instructor. 
• 
A student may not submit for one course substantial portions of work that have been used to fulfill 
the requirements of another course taken at this or any other school without obtaining permission 
from the current professor in advance. 
• 
A student must not intentionally or knowingly help another student to commit an act of academic 
dishonesty. 
• 
Faculty communicate additional expectations and clarifications about discipline-specific practices, 
particular assignments, and collaborative work via syllabi and in-class instructions. 
• 
No one responsible for teaching or assisting in a course, including instructors and teaching 
assistants, will tolerate academic dishonesty.  Infractions of the Academic Integrity Policy will be 
reported by the faculty of record to the academic program administrator, and the Academic Affairs 
Office. The Academic Affairs Office will then notify the Student Affairs Office and Registrar’s Office 
as necessary. 
• 
Violations of the Academic Integrity Policy will result in proportional consequences, which include 
but are not limited to, failure of the assignment, course grade reduction, and failure of the course, 
as stated in the course syllabus. In assigning a consequence, the faculty member (in consultation 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 33 
 June 2023 
 
with the Academic Affairs Office) will consider the type and extent of academic dishonesty involved, 
as well as whether the student has a record of prior offenses.  Mitigating factors, such as the 
student’s cooperation and contrition, may also be considered. 
• 
Additional consequences may be imposed by Grace College and Seminary and might include 
ineligibility for certain student jobs or leadership positions (such as teaching assistantships), 
suspension from campus or the academic program(s), and/or a hearing before a discipline panel.   
• 
A student wishing to appeal a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy and/or penalty resulting 
from such a violation must follow the procedure for an academic appeal as explained in the 
Academic Policy Manual. 
 
Plagiarism                                                                                                                                                  
Plagiarism is defined as presenting someone else’s ideas, language, or work as one’s own without 
properly citing or acknowledging the source. Any ideas or materials taken from another source, whether 
copyrighted or not, must be properly documented unless that information is common knowledge. 
“Common knowledge” refers to information or facts that are widely known within a discipline or a 
course and therefore not attributable to one source.  Examples of plagiarism include failing to cite 
content that originates from the work of another, failing to use quotation marks to identify direct 
quotes, and copying and pasting from any source on any assignment, exam, quiz, PowerPoint slide, 
discussion board or course requirement without identifying the author or reference.  
All of the following are considered plagiarism: 
• 
Turning in someone else's work as your own 
• 
Copying words or ideas from someone else without giving credit 
• 
Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks 
• 
Giving incorrect information about the source of a quotation 
• 
Changing words but copying the sentence structure of a source without giving credit 
• 
Copying so many words or ideas from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether 
you give credit or not (see our section on "fair use" rules) 
 
Retrieved from http://www.plagiarism.org/plagiarism-101/what-is-plagiarism 
Self-Plagiarism 
Just as students are not allowed to present the ideas or work of others without properly giving the 
author credit, they also do not present their own previously submitted work as new scholarship. 
Students may not use direct quotes, paraphrases, or materials from their own work that were previously 
submitted in other courses (for Grace College or any other educational institution) or within a course 
without first obtaining permission from the course instructor. If a student is given permission by the 
course instructor to use previously submitted work, they must cite their work according to APA 
guidelines.  All of the following are considered self-plagiarism: 
• 
Submitting a paper written for a previous course 
• 
Multiple submissions of the same paper to meet different assignments 
• 
Journal entries copied or pasted as discussion board posts 
• 
PowerPoint slides recycled from a previous presentation

Academic Appeal and Review Process 
A. Students have the right to appeal academic decisions in which they believe they have been treated 
unjustly or have been unfairly criticized, and to express grievances related to academic situations. These 
decisions and situations typically include, but are not limited to, those related to grades and grading 
procedures, assessment of student learning (e.g., tests and assignments), classroom policies, instructional or 
classroom management strategies, and advising decisions. Those involved in the dispute (e.g., the student 
and the professor, advisor, internship supervisor or other) are encouraged to use professional discretion, 
integrity, respect, and impartial judgment in resolving issues amongst themselves.  
Students are asked to use the following process for appeals: 
1. Within 10 business days of the situation prompting the student’s concern, the student should 
express his or her concerns via email, a letter, or a phone call, or in a face-to-face conversation 
within a virtual meeting room, to the person responsible for the decision or involved in the dispute 
so that the student can communicate his/her concerns and attempt to resolve the issue between 
the individuals involved. The faculty member or instructor should arrange to meet with the student 
within 10 business days of the student’s request.  
2. If the student remains unsatisfied with the outcome of the decision by the faculty 
member/instructor, the student should put the issue in writing and submit it to the chair of the 
department with 10 business days following the decision reached after completing Step #1. The 
student may include any supporting documentation needed. The written dispute should include 
the facts and concerns about the case and specify the student’s desired outcome. The 
Department Chair will review the concern and respond within 10 business days. In the case 
where the Department Chair is the faculty assigning the grade to be appealed, the student will 
submit the written request to appeal the grade to an appropriately convened, Faculty Appeals 
Committee (FAC).  
3. If the student remains unsatisfied with the outcome of the decision by the Department Chair, the 
student may request that the Department Chair convene a Faculty Appeals Committee (FAC) for 
review of the concern. The FAC will include three (3) faculty members who will review the 
student’s concerns and all supporting documentation from the student and professor and will 
provide a response to the student within 10 business days of being convened. In academic 
appeals in which a student believes that his/her documented disability has affected his/her 
academic performance in the graduate program, the student will have the right to consult with the 
Disability Advisory Team (DAT), which will review the student's concern. In such cases, the FAC will 
give due weight to the DAT's recommendations or other reasonable measures will be taken to 
address the concern. 
Academic Professional Retention Policy                                                                                         
Students must uphold program and college standards, professional counseling standards, and the ACA 
and AACC Codes of Ethics to be retained in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program. These 
essential skills, knowledge, and values may be considered both academic and professional in nature 
and are discussed below. 
RATIONALE: Counseling students are expected to demonstrate professional behavior in the 
classroom, in field agencies, and in both the Grace and broader communities, all of which 
reflect a commitment to the ethics of the Counseling profession. Behavior contrary to these ethics is

Retention Procedure 
Faculty members are to discuss concerns about academic, professional, or interpersonal competence 
directly with students. Following these discussions, faculty complete a Notice of Concern, or for more 
serious issues the DOGC Professional Development Notification (PDN) form, which is a written summary 
of the competence issue(s), an action plan for remediation, and a date for completion of the plan.  The 
plan is monitored by the student’s academic advisor as outlined in the DOGC Catalog section, Academic 
Advising.  Students failing to make substantial changes toward or comply with the objectives agreed 
upon in the PDN will be referred to the SPDC.  Copies of the PDN form are sent to the student, the 
student’s advisor, the department chair and are placed in the student’s file.  A student who receives two 
(2) PDN forms will be referred to the SPDC.  In the case of gross misconduct or behavior posing a risk to 
others, the student will be referred immediately to the SPDC. In the case of suspected criminal activity, 
the student will be referred immediately to the Department of Student Affairs who will consult with the 
Dean and Department Chair to determine appropriate action. Students who believe they have been 
treated unfairly must follow the Appeals Policy as outlined in the DOGC Catalog.  The Dean of the School 
of Behavioral Science maintains final authority regarding a student’s retention in the program. 
Student Professional Development Committee Policies and Procedures 
Student Professional Development Committee                                                                                    
The Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC) is an academic committee responsible for 
monitoring the academic progress, professional competence and behavior of students enrolled in The 
DOGC program. Students who do not meet the academic standards of their program or whose behaviors 
raise concerns about professional competence will be referred to the SPDC. The primary purpose of the 
SPDC is to review submitted information related to concerns about students’ professional development 
and/or competence to determine appropriate steps for remediation or dismissal from the program.  
Committee Membership                                                                                                                                                           
The SPDC consists of at least three (3) voting members to be comprised of School of Behavioral Science 
faculty and one recording secretary. Where three voting members from a single department are not 
available, membership may be interdepartmental. Faculty members are selected by the DOGC Chair or 
Dean of the School of Behavioral Science.  
Referral Procedure   
Any member of the academic community who wishes to bring a student concern before the SPDC must 
submit a formal letter of referral addressed to the Department Chair.  The letter should include specific 
descriptions of academic insufficiencies and subsequent attempts at remediation by faculty, and/or 
descriptions of behaviors that raise concerns about clinical competence and/or professional conduct. If a 
student is already under SPDC review and earns a failing grade, Notice of Concern, or Professional 
Development Notification (PDN), this information will be forwarded to the SPDC for consideration.   
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling

 June 2023 
 
If a student serving at an internship, practicum, or clinical placement is dismissed by the site, asked 
not to return, or fails a site supervisor evaluation, the student’s faculty supervisor will request the 
SPDC to convene for investigation of the circumstances. The focus of the investigation will be to 
determine what happened and appropriate steps for remediation or dismissal from the program.  
Once a referral is received, the committee is convened and follows established procedures.   
Committee Procedures  
The following procedures govern the actions of the SPDC: 
• 
The student should be notified in writing of the requirement to meet with the committee, the 
date and time of the meeting, and the reasons for the referral. The meeting should be held 
within 30 days of the date of receipt of the referral.  
• 
The committee will be convened in a suitable electronic environment.  
• 
In advance of the meeting, the committee may request additional information or 
documentation pertinent to the referral. Where third party witnesses are available, the 
committee may consider meeting with the witnesses in advance.  
• 
The student may submit written information relevant to the situation to the committee chair up 
to 48 hours prior to the meeting.  All written documentation should be made available for 
review by the student, the faculty, and the committee in advance of the meeting.  In cases when 
the situation warrants an immediate convening of the SPDC, the 48 hours for review of 
documentation is waived and the student may present relevant documentation to the 
committee at any time prior to or during the meeting.   
• 
If a student is notified of the meeting and does not attend, the SPDC may continue its action and 
render a decision.  
• 
The student is permitted to have a support person from the academic community present for a 
committee meeting, including another student, faculty or DOGC staff member from Grace 
College.  Support persons may not be family members of the student.  
• 
The support person attending the committee meeting is expected to be visible on the screen, 
but is not permitted to speak during the meeting and must not act as an attorney or an 
advocate because students are expected to speak on their own behalf. Support persons are not 
permitted to speak to or coach the student during the meeting. 
• 
The student is not permitted to bring legal counsel to committee meetings. 
• 
Verbatim transcription or electronic recording of the meeting is not permitted.  The recording 
secretary will transcribe minutes of the meeting and subsequent decisions.   
• 
The committee should ensure that the student has been apprised of the concerns and has had 
an opportunity to respond.  
• 
Within ten (10) business days of the meeting the committee members shall render a decision on 
what course of action is required. The outcomes may include, but are not limited to the following: 
o Referral to advisor, Clinical Coordinator, or DOGC faculty member for remediation using 
a specific plan created by the SPDC committee including identified academic and/or 
behavioral outcomes, consequences, and process for monitoring.   
o Referral to outside resources 
o Probation with explicit requirements and a timeline for removal from probation. The 
committee should include any consequences for noncompliance with probation 
requirements  
o Program dismissal  
• 
The committee should also consider whether the program or student should take any follow up

action with an internship or practicum site, with an instructor, or with another student in order to 
preserve or reconcile a professional relationship.   
• 
The committee chair shall inform the student and appropriate faculty of its decision and any 
remediation requirements in writing within ten (10) business days of the committee’s decision.  In 
all cases, the faculty should describe the problems resulting in referral and the recommended 
solutions in specific detail. 
 
Monitoring Progress                                                                                                                                                                  
The SPDC Committee uses the following procedures for monitoring the progress of students referred to 
SPDC for concerns about academic and/or behavioral competencies. 
A. When a student has been placed on probation, the SPDC will develop and provide to the 
student the explicit requirements that must be completed, a date for reporting completion to 
the committee, and the consequences for failing to reach the desired goals.  The student will 
communicate with the Committee Chair for questions related to the requirements and will 
submit all documentation of compliance to the chair by the established date. Within ten (10) 
business days of receipt of the student’s documentation, the Committee Chair will either notify 
the student in writing that the documentation or actions taken by the student do not meet the 
agreed upon criteria or will issue a letter stating that the competency has been resolved and no 
further action by the SPDC is needed at this time. It is noted that resolving a competency does 
not preclude the student from being referred to the committee at another time for further 
concerns about the same or other competencies. If the documentation is not submitted by the 
required date or the actions taken by the student do not meet the criteria specified by the 
SPDC, the committee will reconvene to determine the next course of action, which can include 
dismissal from the program.  
 
B. When a student has been referred to outside resources, the student will be provided with a 
date for providing a progress report to the SPDC on the outcomes of the referrals. The progress 
report should be in the form of a letter from the outside source(s) that provides an update of 
the student’s progression in the competency that was cited as a concern by the SPDC. While 
the SPDC does not require the student to waive confidentiality, the student will be required to 
sign a limited waiver of confidentiality with the outside source, allowing the Committee Chair 
to ascertain that the student and the outside referral source are remediating the identified 
competence and that the student is making progress. It is noted that resolving a competency 
does not preclude the student from being referred to the committee at another time for 
further concerns about the same or other competencies. While the student is working with an 
outside referral source, should the student demonstrate ongoing concerns regarding the 
identified or other competencies before that time, the SPDC will reconvene to determine the 
next course of action, including remediation, probation, or dismissal from the program.  
C. When the SPDC determines that a student will be dismissed from the program, the dismissal is 
immediate and will follow the policy outlined in the DOGC Catalog under Program Dismissal.  
D. If a student is already under SPDC review and earns a failing grade or Professional Development 
Notification (PDN), the SPDC will convene to consider whether current remediation should be 
continued, revised, or if the student should be dismissed.   
The committee should also consider whether the program or student should take any follow up action 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 41 
 June 2023 
 
with an internship or practicum site, with an instructor, or with another student in order to preserve or 
reconcile a professional relationship.   
The committee chair shall inform the student and appropriate faculty of its decision and any 
remediation requirements in writing within 10 business days of the committee’s decision. In all cases, 
the faculty should describe the problems before it and the recommended solutions in specific detail.   
Students with Disabilities Appearing Before SPDC 
When a student has a documented disability, the SPDC works with the Grace College Disability 
Services Coordinator to ensure required accommodations for committee proceedings are provided. 
All students with or without a documented disability must perform to the standards of conduct and 
academic achievement required by Grace College and the DOGC CMHC program. Accommodations 
are not retroactive and the failure to request accommodations does not forgive past 
difficulties.  Referral for mandatory evaluation is the purview of the dean of the School of Behavioral 
Science.   
Appeal Process  
If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the SPDC committee, the student may submit a 
written appeal of the decision to the Dean of the School of Behavioral Science within ten (10) 
business days of receiving the written documentation from the SPDC. Within ten (10) business days 
of the receipt of the appeal, an Appeals committee comprised of the Dean and two faculty members 
from the college community outside of the DOGC will convene to consider and render a decision 
regarding the student’s appeal. Any results of the SPDC proceedings will remain in place until the 
Appeals committee renders a decision otherwise. The student must obey the terms of the SPDC 
decision pending the outcome of the appeal.  
Counseling Skills and Practicum  
 
Counseling Skills                                                                                                                                
Counseling Skills is a crucial learning component of the DOGC. One aspect of this course involves 
addressing the student’s personal life issues (problems, background, relational style, etc.) which may 
impede or enhance therapeutic work with clients. Issues that could be detrimental to counseling will be 
addressed because of the commitment to the well-being of clients and a desire to avoid sending out 
graduates who could do harm to their clients. The process may be disruptive at times; however, we 
believe it is necessary for the well-being of clients. Our goal in this process is to help the students grow 
in Christ and become the most effective counselor possible.  
Another aspect of this course involves the acquisition of counseling skills while continuing to look at 
personal life issues that impede therapeutic work with clients. The various skills of counseling will be 
taught via methods such as classroom instruction, role-play, and videos. Students will practice skills in 
class, within triadic groups comprised of Counseling Skills class members, or with volunteers. Students 
will provide tapes of practice sessions and faculty evaluate students to determine if they are prepared to 
advance to Practicum.  
Practicum                                                                                                                                                         
After the successful completion of the Counseling Skills course the student is eligible for Practicum.  
Students must have completed or are simultaneously taking the following: Counseling Skills (CPY5350), 
Foundations of CMHC (CPY5100), Group Counseling (CPY6350), Psychopathology (CPY5250) and 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 42 
 June 2023 
 
Theories of Personality and Counseling (CPY5200). The Practicum experience is designed to provide the 
student with actual counseling experience, along with group and individual supervision. Practicum must 
be completed at approved clinical sites within the United States or recognized U.S. military installation.   
Students will not be allowed to take more than 36 hours before taking practicum, unless 
they have been given a specific waiver to do so.  
 
Practicum is a 16-week course in which the student will accumulate 100 clinical hours in the following 
manner:  
Direct service with clients with at least 10 in group work 
40 
Individual supervision (with appropriately licensed faculty or site 
supervisors (e.g. LMHC, LMFT, LCSW) 
15  
Group supervision facilitated by a faculty member 
24 
Other indirect clinical hours (research, note writing, site training, etc.) 
21  
             Total 
100 hrs. 
 
 
Counseling Skills and Practicum Credit/No Credit Policy                                                                
One way in which students are “screened” for interpersonal attributes and behaviors that may do harm 
to clients is through the Counseling Skills and Practicum classes. This is the reason a “Credit/No Credit” 
(“CR”-”NC”) system is used for these courses. If a student receives “Credit” (“CR”), then the student may 
proceed to the next clinical course.  If a student receives “No Credit” (“NC”), then he or she is required 
to repeat the failed course before advancing to the next.  Prior to or after receiving a NC, a referral may 
be made to the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC).   
A student may receive “NC” for one (or more) of the following reasons: 
1. More than one (1) absence during scheduled Faculty Group Supervision in Practicum (CPY 5700 I). 
2. Inadequate, incomplete, or unacceptable Case Study presentations (as determined by the 
Instructor/Faculty Supervisor).  
3. Disciplinary actions that are the result of unprofessional/unethical conduct either at the 
Practicum/Internship site or in the classroom and/or failure to comply with directions and 
consultation given by either the Faculty Supervisor or any Site Supervisor. All disciplinary problems 
will be documented in the student’s file. 
4. If the Faculty Supervisor determines that the student’s current emotional, mental or physical well-
being compromises the integrity of the Practicum/Internship experience or potentially places the 
student or others in harm’s way or in an unduly vulnerable position. All such cases will be brought to 
the attention of the Clinical Coordinator and the Program Chair. 
5. If there is a question or concern of competency in areas such as (but not limited to): 
a. Interpersonal and professional competence (e.g., the ways in which a student relates to clients, 
peers, faculty, allied professionals, the public, and individuals from diverse backgrounds or 
histories) 
b. Self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-evaluation (e.g., knowledge of the content and potential 
impact of one's own beliefs and values on clients, peers, faculty, allied professionals, the public, 
and individuals from diverse backgrounds or histories) 
c. Openness to processes of supervision (e.g., the ability and willingness to explore issues that 
either interfere with the appropriate provision of care or impede professional development or 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 43 
 June 2023 
 
functioning) 
d. Resolution of problems or issues that interfere with professional development or functioning in 
a satisfactory manner (e.g., by responding constructively to feedback from supervisors or 
program faculty; by participating in personal therapy in order to resolve problems or issues) 
 
If the student receives “No Credit” (“NC”) or indicators of below expectations on the Practicum Site 
Supervisor Evaluation Form, the DOGC faculty may require work outside of the program in order to 
address the issue(s) involved. This may include but is not limited to extra course work, counseling, and 
accountability. It is the responsibility of the student to pay for the costs that may be incurred due to 
required remedial work.  
If one of the above listed problem areas is discovered, there are two steps to the remediation process: 
1. The student is provided with a written copy of the Practicum Evaluation Form and meets with 
the professor to discuss problematic areas.     
2. If a student receives one or more Professional Characteristic indicators at below expectations 
on the Practicum Evaluation Form, the student will be required to meet with the professor to 
discuss remediation.  A copy of the evaluation scale and any action taken will be given to the 
student and placed in the student’s file. 
If, at the final evaluation, the student has not satisfactorily and successfully completed the remedial 
work in its entirety and/or receives one or more professional characteristic indicators of a “1” (below 
expectations) on the Practicum Evaluation form, the student will earn a “No Credit” (“NC”) and a 
Professional Development Notification will be issued.     
In addition, prior to or after receiving an NC, a referral may be made to the Student Professional 
Development Committee (SPDC).  In order to repeat the course, additional remedial work may be 
required. The student may repeat that particular class only one time. Receiving “NC” twice for a 
particular class will result in dismissal from the program. If the student is informed that he or she will 
be dismissed from the program, the instructor will meet with the student to discuss alternative 
educational/ employment options. A referral will also be made to the director of Career Services. 
Please Note: The decision to give “NC” to a student will be made by the class professor. If the student 
wishes to challenge this decision, the student must follow the academic appeal and review process. Also 
note: At any point during the remediation process, a student may be referred to the SPDC.  
Subjective Component of Credit/No Credit Grading                                                                             
In the final analysis, all grading is subjective. It is highly dependent upon the observations, experience, 
and professional and academic judgments of the DOGC faculty. The decision to award “Credit” or “No 
Credit” is based upon how students respond to and achieve what the professor has determined should 
be achieved in role-plays, tapes, paperwork, critiques, group discussion feedback, case scenario 
presentations, completion of readings, etc.  
The award of “Credit/No Credit” is also developed within a comparative analysis with other students. 
The reality is that not all students in Counseling Skills/Practicum work are at the same levels. Not all 
have the same goals, clinical skills, cognitive capabilities, level of interest, work ethic, experiential 
background, or maturity. Therefore, not all students may receive “Credit” for the course. 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 44 
 June 2023 
 
When students have agency supervisors along with a supervisor for Practicum, the Practicum supervisor 
is considered the primary supervisor and the agency supervisor is considered the secondary supervisor. 
The primary supervisor will make the final decision as to whether a student will receive “Credit” or “No 
Credit” for the class. The feedback from the agency supervisor will be requested and incorporated into 
the final decision; however, the final decision remains with the Counseling Skills/Practicum Faculty 
Supervisor.  
Site Supervisor Concerns Regarding Practicum Students                                                                      
If the agency supervisor perceives that the student is not meeting minimal standards of competency at 
the Practicum site, the agency supervisor will identify challenges and possible solutions the student will 
need to meet. If the agency supervisor believes additional work is necessary for the student, a written 
remedial plan will be developed by mid semester. The remedial plan will need to be completed 
satisfactorily and in its entirety by the end of the semester. A copy of this remedial plan will be given to 
the student and the Practicum, Internship, and Advanced Internship supervisor.  
If a remedial plan cannot be agreed upon between the agency supervisor and the student, the Practicum 
faculty supervisor will be notified. The Practicum faculty supervisor will meet with the student and the 
agency supervisor and make a reasonable attempt to help all parties reach a satisfactory agreement. 
The Practicum faculty supervisor reserves the right to make a site visit and to observe the student’s 
practice within the agency.  
Up to the three-quarter point in the semester, a student has the opportunity to obtain a new agency 
supervisor at the present site if a new agency supervisor is available. If an alternative agency supervisor 
is not available at that site, the student will need to obtain an alternative site and alternative agency 
supervisor. The student will need to discuss these plans with the Practicum faculty supervisor. If the 
student decides to obtain an alternative supervisor, the remedial work still needs to be completed to 
the full satisfaction of the Practicum faculty supervisor. 
Please note: At any point during the process in which an agency supervisor perceives that a student is not 
meeting minimal standards, a student may be subject to referral to the SPDC. 
Guidelines for Counseling Internships 
Internship and Advanced Internship 
Two (2) internships are required for the 60-hour M.A. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling degree: 
1.  Internship in Clinical Mental Health Counseling: Internship is to be completed in a clinical mental 
health facility under the supervision of a fully licensed clinical supervisor (e.g., LMHC, LCSW, 
LMFT). See course syllabus for details. Students are responsible for knowing and meeting the 
number of hours required for licensure in their current state of residence.    
2.  Advanced Internship in Clinical Mental Health Counseling: Advanced Internship is to be 
completed in a clinical mental health facility. Students are responsible for knowing and meeting 
the number of hours required for licensure in their current state of residence.    
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 45 
 June 2023 
 
3.    Supervision evaluations will be used as a major determinant for the student to receive a “CR” or 
“NC” for each respective course. If a student receives an “NC” for a course, that course may be 
repeated one (1) time only. A second “NC” will result in termination from the program.  
IMPORTANT: Internships are clinical courses required to develop and refine advanced counseling skills 
that conceptually link counseling theory and practice in a clinical setting.  All Internship courses must 
be completed at approved clinical sites and have a fully licensed clinical supervisor (e.g. LMHC, LCSW, 
LMFT) on site.   
Paid Internship Policy                                                                                                                                 
Many internship sites offer non-paid positions. However, the DOGC M.A. in Clinical Mental Health 
Counseling degree will allow paid positions to be used for internship credits as long as certain 
requirements are met. The site must meet the criteria established by the DOGC. The student must 
obtain approval from the site supervisor and class instructor before the internship begins. The student 
must discuss the clinical experiences he or she expects to pursue in the paid position with the internship 
supervisor to ensure the student gains a variety of clinical experiences. If the student is employed with 
the internship-issuing agency before enrolling in internship, the internship experience must be beyond 
the scope of their current job description. The student must also complete and submit a Work 
Internship Agreement to the Clinical Coordinator for approval prior to signing an Agency Agreement 
with the site.  
Intern Performance Evaluation/Criteria and Procedures: 
1. Internship Credit/No-Credit Policy 
Counseling involves extensive personal investment. Consequently, Interns will be learning more 
than knowledge and acquiring skills. Internship is challenging both academically and emotionally 
and Interns will likely be affected in the development of learning clinical skills. Intern 
participation in this clinical experience will not always be a comfortable experience.  We utilize a 
Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) system as a method of preventing Interns who may cause more harm 
than good to clients from progressing in the clinical components of the program. If an Intern 
receives CR, then the Intern may proceed to Advanced Internship. If an Intern receives NC, then 
the Intern is issued a Professional Development Notification and must repeat the Internship 
course before moving to the next level. Prior to or after receiving a NC, a referral may be made 
to the Student Professional Development Committee (SPDC).  In order to repeat the course, 
additional remedial work may be required.  The Intern may repeat Internship one time only.  A 
mark of NC during the second Internship attempt will result in dismissal from the program. 
NOTE: The decision to give NC to an Intern will be made by the faculty supervisor. If the Intern 
wishes to challenge this decision, the Intern must follow the Academic Appeal and Review 
Process.  If the Intern is informed that he or she will be dismissed from the program, the 
student’s faculty advisor will meet with the Intern to discuss alternative 
educational/employment options.  A referral could also be made to the Director of Career 
Services for assistance. 
The Intern may receive “NC” for one (or more) of the following reasons: 
1. More than (2) two total absences during Faculty Group Supervision over Internship and 
Advanced Internship (CPY 6700 I and CPY 6710 I). A student cannot have more than one 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 46 
 June 2023 
 
absence per semester. 
2. Inadequate, incomplete, or unacceptable Case Study presentations (as determined by the 
Instructor/Faculty Supervisor).  
3. Disciplinary actions that are the result of unprofessional/unethical conduct either at the 
Practicum/Internship site or in the classroom and/or failure to comply with directions and 
consultation given by either the Faculty Supervisor or any Site Supervisor. All disciplinary 
problems will be documented in the student’s file. 
4. If the Faculty Supervisor determines that the student’s current emotional, mental or physical 
well-being compromises the integrity of the Practicum/Internship experience or potentially 
places the student or others in harm’s way or in an unduly vulnerable position. All such cases 
will be brought to the attention of the Clinical Coordinator and the Program Chair. 
5. If there is a question or concern of competency in areas such as (but not limited to): 
a. Interpersonal and professional competence (e.g., the ways in which a student relates to 
clients, peers, faculty, allied professionals, the public, and individuals from diverse 
backgrounds or histories) 
b. Self-awareness, self-reflection, and self-evaluation (e.g., knowledge of the content and 
potential impact of one's own beliefs and values on clients, peers, faculty, allied 
professionals, the public, and individuals from diverse backgrounds or histories) 
c. Openness to processes of supervision (e.g., the ability and willingness to explore issues 
that either interfere with the appropriate provision of care or impede professional 
development or functioning) 
d. Resolution of problems or issues that interfere with professional development or 
functioning in a satisfactory manner (e.g., by responding constructively to feedback 
from supervisors or program faculty; by participating in personal therapy in order to 
resolve problems or issues) 
 
Please note: At any point during the internship evaluation process, a student may be subject to 
referral to the SPDC. 
2. Subjective Component of Credit/No Credit Grading  
In the final analysis, all grading is subjective.  It is highly dependent upon the observations, 
experience, and professional and academic judgments of the Counseling Department faculty. The 
decision to award “Credit” or “No-Credit” decisions is based upon how Interns respond to and 
achieve what the faculty supervisor has determined should be achieved, in recordings, paperwork, 
group supervision and feedback, case presentations, completion of readings, and on other tasks. 
The award of “Credit” or “No Credit” is also developed within a comparative analysis with other 
Interns.  The reality is that not all Interns in Internship work at the same level. Not all have set the 
same goals, possess the same clinical skills or cognitive capabilities, or have the same level of 
interest, work ethic, experiential background, or maturity. Therefore, some Interns may not receive 
a credit for the course. When Interns have Site Supervisors along with a faculty supervisor, the 
faculty supervisor will make the final decision as to whether an Intern will receive “Credit” or “No-
Credit” for the class. The feedback from the Site Supervisor will be requested and incorporated into 
the final decision; however, the final decision remains with the faculty supervisor.   
Site Supervisor Concerns Regarding Interns                                                                                            
If the Site Supervisor perceives that the Intern is not meeting minimal standards of competence at the 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023 – 2025 
Department of Graduate Counseling 
 47 
 June 2023 
 
internship site, the Site Supervisor will identify challenges and possible solutions for the Intern.  If the 
Site Supervisor believes additional work is necessary for the Intern, a written remedial plan will be 
developed by mid semester. The remedial plan will need to be completed in its entirety by the end of 
the semester. A copy of this remedial plan will be given to the Intern and the internship supervisor. If a 
remedial plan cannot be agreed upon between the Site Supervisor and the Intern, the Internship Faculty 
will be notified.  Faculty will meet (or correspond by phone) with the Intern and the Site Supervisor and 
make a reasonable attempt to help all parties reach a satisfactory agreement.   
In the case of irresolvable conflicts and up to the three-quarter point in the semester, the Intern has the 
opportunity to obtain a new Site Supervisor at the present site if a new Site Supervisor is available.  If an 
alternative Site Supervisor is not available at that site the Intern may obtain an alternative site and 
alternative Site Supervisor.  The Intern will need to discuss these plans with faculty.  If the Intern decides 
to obtain an alternative supervisor, the remedial work assigned by the original Site Supervisor must still 
be completed to the full satisfaction of faculty.  Please note: At any point during the internship 
evaluation process, a student may be subject to referral to the SPDC. 
Intern Concerns Regarding the Site Supervisor                                                                                       
If the Intern has concerns/conflict with the Site Supervisor the Intern should meet with the Site 
Supervisor to attempt to resolve the stated concerns (if the concerns are regarding a perceived 
ethical/moral violation on the part of the Site Supervisor, the Intern would be advised to discuss this 
with faculty).  If a resolution cannot be achieved then the Intern should contact the faculty supervisor.  
Faculty will contact the Site Supervisor to make a reasonable attempt to help all parties reach a 
satisfactory agreement.  If a resolution cannot be achieved for the Intern, then the Intern reserves the 
right to select an alternative supervisor/site. 
Miscellaneous re: Clinical Work 
Dress Code for Counseling Skills, Practicum, Internship, and Advanced Internship                       
Students should dress modestly and professionally when meeting with students/clients for Counseling 
Skills, Practicum, Internship or Advanced Internship. Casual clothing such as jeans, overalls, shorts, t-
shirts, sweatshirts, etc., should be avoided. If the student is working with an agency for Practicum, 
Internship, or Advanced Internship, the dress code of that agency should be followed. 
Liability Insurance                                                                                                                                     
Students in Practicum, and Internship/Advanced Internship are required to purchase liability insurance 
prior to clinical classes.  Specific information regarding the liability insurance requirement is available via 
the class syllabus and on the portal. 
Confidentiality of Client Information

 Memorandum Agreement 
 
Students are required to read, sign, and submit this form each year 
 
The program faculty in the Department of Graduate Counseling at Grace College believes that 
the interpersonal awareness and growth of counseling students is a demonstration of Christian 
integrity and a prime requisite for proficiency as a counselor. Therefore, in addition to academic 
performance, faculty evaluate all counseling students to determine competence in 
interpersonal skills, self-awareness, and professional behavior as outlined in the Department of 
Graduate Counseling Catalog and Student Handbook section entitled DOGC Retention Criteria. 
If faculty perceive that personal issues may be impacting a student’s ability to demonstrate 
these successfully, faculty are ethically required to evaluate and recommend a remedial course 
of action.  Typically, that recommendation involves professional counseling for the student with 
a non-DOGC- affiliated mental health provider. If personal issues are not resolved, the faculty of 
the Department of Graduate Counseling, through the Student Professional Development 
Committee process, in conjunction with the Dean of the School of Behavioral Sciences will 
review the appropriateness of the student’s continuance in the counseling program. 
 
The above is in compliance with the ACA Ethical Guidelines (2014), Sections F.8.c., 
F.8.d., F.9.a., and F.9.b., pp. 14 – 15. 
 
I have read and understood the above statements.

We believe that God has created each one of us with a life purpose.  This purpose or call on one’s life is 
a summons or internal drive to perform a certain function or enter a career.  Our passion in the Grace 
College School of Business is to create an environment in which each student is encouraged and 
challenged to find the calling of God in his or her life and to foster entrepreneurial creativity as they 
reflect the creator God.  This approach to business education is compelling, incorporating calling, 
purpose, and mission as the student comes to more fully understand his or her own skills, abilities, 
personality tendencies, values, dreams and passions.  We believe that people serving together can make 
a more substantial difference than individuals who are serving others alone.  This cooperative impact is 
the purpose of the modern corporation.  Serving others is important, but serving God is the driving force 
behind what we teach our students and the manner in which that occurs.  Our focus is on bringing glory 
to God in all that we do which includes our service to others through our vocations.  
 
The Grace Business program emphasizes biblical integration, practical application, and breadth of 
preparation.  This balanced approach provides preparation for entry into a variety of business 
occupations as well as a foundation for graduate study.  Business courses, along with the liberal arts 
requirements, provide substantive undergraduate coverage of the functions of the business firm, an 
understanding of the environment of business and human behavior, and an opportunity to develop 
one’s personal Christian commitment and ethical sensitivity.  There are several opportunities to exercise 
entrepreneurial abilities. From the Entrepreneurship and Service Practicum in the sophomore year 
where students design, organize and run an actual business on campus, to the Business Plan 
Competition, which results in financial support to create the business from the winning team’s plan. 
 
All business department majors include 42 credit hours of Common Professional Components providing 
a broad foundation on which to pursue more specific areas of study.  The School of Business offers 
several areas of study; Accounting, Business Administration, Business Education, Entrepreneurial 
Management, Facility & Event Management, Finance, Information Systems, International Business, 
Management (with concentrations in General Management, Human Resources Management, Project 
Management, and Supply Chain Management), Management of Information Systems, Marketing (with 
concentrations in Traditional Marketing, Digital Marketing and Professional Sales), Sport Business, and 
Sport Management.  Minor areas of study include: Accounting, Business Administration, Digital 
Marketing, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Information Systems, International Business, Management, 
Marketing, and Sport Management.  Other majors supported by the School of Business: Actuarial 
Science and Sport Ministry.

Through our relationship with the William P. Gordon Institute for Enterprise Development, the School of 
Business recognizes its commitment to serve our community and allows students to gain practical

Professional Career Development   
Attending college is a life changing experience in many ways.  Career preparation is one of the expected 
outcomes of a comprehensive business program.  At Grace College, we put a strong emphasis on the 
characteristics that employers are asking for in the graduates they hire.  The National Association of 
Colleges and Employers (NACE) and the Quality Assurance Commons for Higher and Postsecondary 
Education have identified eight qualities that are essential for new graduates to exhibit in their behavior.  
Those “Eight Essential Employability Qualities” are encouraged and measured across the Business School

communicating, problem solving, inquiry, collaboration, adaptability, ethical decision making, 
professionalism, and finally the desire to learn.

MISSION AND GOAL 
The mission of the school is “Preparing teachers of character who are competent in the profession and 
have a heart of service for others.” The foundation of the mission is based on Micah 6:8, which states, 
“He has shown you . . . what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love 
mercy and to walk humbly with your God.” We apply this in these ways: Character—walk humbly; 
Competence—act justly; and Service—love mercy. Education students graduate as productive and 
redemptive educators in the world. They are prepared to transfer that value system and worldview to 
the citizens of tomorrow. The students are systematically exposed to a biblically grounded, 
philosophically and educationally consistent set of liberal arts values that are institutionally endorsed. 
The primary objective of the School of Education is the development of prospective teachers who 
possess dispositions, knowledge, and skills to be effective in a career in the field of education. The 
School of Education has the specific charge to students to provide guidance in recognizing their 
aptitudes and deficiencies in the areas of communication skills, pedagogy, understanding of the learning 
process, and human growth and development with respect to effective teaching.  
Guidance in the educational components of planning, instruction, classroom management, and 
professionalism permeate the curriculum. Graduating educators of character who are competent in 
their content and have a heart for service to others is the desire of the school. 
Having completed a teaching major at Grace College, the education graduate will be able to meet the 10 
INTASC standards: 
1. The moral practitioner understands how learners grow and develop, recognizing that patterns of 
learning and development vary individually within and across the cognitive, linguistic, social, 
emotional, and physical areas, and designs and implements developmentally appropriate and 
challenging learning experiences. 
 
2. The moral practitioner uses understanding of individual differences and diverse cultures and 
communities to ensure inclusive learning environments that enable each learner to meet high 
standards. 
 
3. The moral practitioner works with others to create environments that support individual and 
collaborative learning, and that encourage positive social interaction, active engagement in learning, 
and self-motivation.

4. The moral practitioner understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the 
discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make the discipline accessible 
and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content. 
 
5. The moral practitioner understands how to connect concepts and use differing perspectives to 
engage learners in critical thinking, creativity, and collaborative problem solving related to authentic 
local and global issues. 
 
6. The moral practitioner understands and uses multiple methods of assessment to engage learners in 
their own growth, to monitor learner progress, and to guide the teacher’s and learner’s decision 
making. 
 
7. The moral practitioner plans instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous learning 
goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills, and 
pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context. 
 
8. The moral practitioner understands and uses a variety of instructional strategies to encourage 
learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and their connections, and to build skills to 
apply knowledge in meaningful ways. 
 
9. The moral practitioner engages in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence to continually 
evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her choices and actions on others (learners, 
families, other professionals, and the community), and adapts practice to meet the needs of each 
learner. 
 
10. The moral practitioner seeks appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility 
for student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals, 
and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession. 
 
The School of Education has the overall responsibility for all of the teacher education programs of Grace 
College, regardless of the specific teaching field. All teacher education programs are under the guidance 
of the Dean of the School of Education. The Teacher Education Committee is composed of faculty 
members who are directly involved in teacher preparation for the Elementary Education, Teaching All 
Learners, and Secondary Education majors. 
 
PROGRAMS IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION 
Elementary Education 
The focus of the Elementary Education Program is to prepare candidates in the dispositions, knowledge, 
and skills needed to be effective in the K-6 classroom. Graduates of the program will be teachers of 
character who are competent in the profession and have a heart for service. The program includes a 
balance of foundational content and methods courses focused on current, research-based practices and 
procedures. Course content is designed to provide guided training in the educational components of 
planning, instruction, classroom management, and professionalism. 
In addition to campus-based coursework, candidates also receive 100+ hours of field experience work in 
local K-6 classrooms. Faculty members teaching in the program include professors highly skilled and 
trained in the area of elementary education as well as practicing teachers and building administrators. 
This combination provides for the perfect blend of theory and applied practice.

Teaching All Learners (TAL—dual program in Elementary Education and Special 
Education) 
The Teaching All Learners major is a dual licensure in elementary education (K-6) and mild intervention 
(P-12) that meets the state of Indiana’s exceptional needs licensure requirements to teach students 
needing mild interventions including those with learning disabilities at all levels, emotional and 
behavioral disorders, mild cognitive disabilities, autism, and ADHD. Our Special Education program is 
dedicated to equipping candidates in the dispositions, knowledge, and skills needed to be effective in 
the inclusive classroom. Graduates of the program will be teachers of character who are competent in 
the profession and have a heart for service. 
The program includes a balance of content and methods courses focused on current, research-based 
practices and methodology. In addition to campus-based coursework, candidates receive more than 15 
hours of field experience in local classrooms. 
INTENSE INTERVENTION 
The intense intervention graduate licensure program allows undergraduate students actively pursuing 
the mild intervention licensure as well as professional educators in the field who already have their mild 
intervention license to add to their pedagogical repertoire the knowledge and skills in teaching students 
P-12 who require intense interventions. Candidates who complete this 15-hour program are eligible for 
exceptional needs: intense intervention licensure through the Indiana Department of Education. 
 
The curriculum for this graduate level licensure program has been intentionally developed by experts in 
the field of significant disabilities, autism, and communication disorders. The scope of the curriculum is 
focused on understanding and meeting the intense needs of the learner with exceptionalities.  
 
The online coursework provides opportunities to delve into evidenced-based practices, theoretical 
applications, legal implications, as well as current trends all while collaborating with a cohort of learners. 
A variety of instructional tasks and assessments allow candidates the opportunity to demonstrate 
proficiency in their knowledge and skills.  
 
The clinical experiences are designed with a scaffolded approach that vary in intensity and 
developmental levels. Experiences range from observations to supervised teaching with a focus on the 
gradual development of competency in practice. Field and clinical experiences provide teacher 
candidates opportunities to view the entire scope of teaching students with significant disabilities and to 
develop the knowledge and skills necessary to be effective practitioners.  Each course in the Intense 
Intervention Licensure Program requires a field or clinical component which allows for authentic 
connections, applications, and practice during the course of study.

TEACHING LICENSES 
Since all of the teacher education programs have been approved by the Indiana Department of 
Education, graduates of these programs who have been approved by the Teacher Education Committee 
and who have met the state regulations are eligible to receive the standard instructional license from 
the State of Indiana. The teacher education program is also approved by the Association of Christian 
Schools International, making ACSI Certification available to graduates. 
The Indiana Department of Education may adopt changes in legislation that impact curriculum for 
colleges and universities with programs in teacher education. While specific courses may be changed in 
name, description and hours, a student’s overall requirements will be similar to those stated in this 
catalog. Therefore, Grace College reserves the right to change the required curriculum for all 
Elementary, All Grade, Dual Licensure, and Secondary Education majors during a student’s course of 
study in order to meet the requirements for licensure in the state of Indiana. 
APPLIED LEARNING 
The 3 hours of required internship experience will be covered through the student teaching semester 
experience.  
EDUCATION PLACEMENT 
Graduating seniors in teacher education and alumni seeking positions in various schools have an on-
campus service to assist them in obtaining such positions through the Center for Career Connections. 
Files of both position openings and qualified candidates are maintained for use by employers and by 
those seeking positions. 
Professional Education Semester 
Each student enrolled in a program leading to a teaching license must plan to include a professional 
semester during his/her senior year (typically the spring semester). The majority of that semester 
involves the student in full-time, supervised student teaching in an approved public and/or private 
school. Some majors also have the opportunity to participate in an alternative student teaching 
placement for the five to seven weeks following a successful local student teaching placement. These 
alternative settings may be in an inner-city setting, in another country, or in another approved cross-
cultural site. All candidates will be required to participate in a professional seminar (SED 4700 Moral 
Practitioner) during the professional semester. 
ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS 
Students planning to pursue a program leading to licensure for teaching must declare the major both 
with the Registrar and in the School of Education Office. This should be done by the end of the first year. 
Failure to start the necessary sequence of courses early in the student’s academic program may require 
the student to take extra work during the summer or delay graduation. 
 
Requirements for entry into and continuance in teacher education are provided to the candidate when 
he/she declares and are available in the School of Education office. To attain candidacy status and 
therefore continue in the School of Education, students must meet a list of criteria.  Students must

PURPOSE  
The Biblical Studies Department prepares disciples of Jesus Christ to be servant-leaders both in church 
and society.  The Department of Biblical Studies faculty is committed to passionate and accurate study 
of God’s Word, to living out our faith with dynamic spirituality, and to thoughtful engagement with the 
world around us.  
Christianity is a set of beliefs and practices associated with the devotion, worship, and service of God. It 
rests on the belief that the Bible stands alone as the inerrant revelation of God and that Jesus is the one 
and only way of reconciliation with a holy and loving God. The department’s commitment to these two 
foundational truths has a direct bearing on all aspects of life—intellectual, moral, physical, and spiritual. 
In a world confused by the marketplace of competing ideas, the only real answers to life come from the 
Word of God who is the only standard for both faith and practice.  
FOCUS  
Foundational to this department is the Word of God —what it meant as originally given and what its 
significance is today.  Learning how to interpret and apply Scripture correctly is the most important thing 
students can learn. That is addressed in departmental courses specifically on the Bible, in courses on the 
cultures and literatures of the biblical world, and in courses in biblical languages. 
Since we live in a real world with complex issues, Christians need to be prepared to handle those issues 
with correct biblical responses. Hence, we offer courses in various areas of theology, apologetics, biblical 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025

studies, spiritual formation, intercultural studies, and preaching. We emphasize in all our courses 
putting faith into practice recognizing the Bible as the ultimate, inerrant authority. 
MAJORS AND MINORS  
The department offers  seven majors: Biblical Studies, Intercultural Studies, Youth Ministry, Educational 
Ministries, Bible Translation, Sport Ministry Studies and a Bible major (this latter major is available only 
to those who are also enrolled in another non-Biblical Studies major). There are also four minors: Biblical 
Studies, Biblical Languages, Youth Ministry Studies, and Intercultural Studies. Students majoring in 
Biblical Studies programs are encouraged to double-major. Our programs are especially crucial for those 
desiring to serve the body of Christ as pastors, professors, youth workers, missionaries, etc., but our 
mission reaches beyond that. We want to prepare leaders for a variety of roles in society. In today’s 
world, the study of Scripture and faith is excellent preparation for all who wish to impact society with 
the gospel of Christ. 
Generally, the education offered by this department is not terminal, in the sense of providing everything 
students need for ministry. Further study is encouraged, such as that offered at the seminary level. But 
the departmental curriculum is designed to provide the best possible foundation for future study and 
ministry. Note that graduates of the Biblical Studies Department may gain advanced standing in Grace 
Theological Seminary. 
VALUES-DRIVEN CURRICULUM 
The Biblical Studies Department is driven by the following values: 
1.  We seek to offer students a comprehensive introduction to biblical studies and related fields within 
an evangelical framework. With so many topics to cover and with a limited number of hours that 
students may take in three or four years of college, our curriculum is designed to be compact yet 
complete, efficient yet excellent. 
2.  We seek to model before students what it means to apply our minds at the highest level possible in 
the study of the Bible and related subjects, while having hearts deeply committed to the God of the 
Bible. We want students to be dedicated to advancing God’s kingdom and to serving the people of 
Christ’s church. 
3.  We seek to guide students in developing an approach to biblical studies that is informed by 
scholarship. We encourage students to be well read and familiar with sources for understanding 
Christianity and the Bible. Morgan Library has an excellent collection in the field of biblical studies. 
Department courses will generally require significant research in the library. The library also houses 
the department’s collection of ancient manuscripts. Hebrew scrolls and Greek papyri provide 
students firsthand acquaintance with the transmission of the Bible. 
GOALS  
The department has adopted the following goals and objectives:  
1.  Students will demonstrate biblical literacy. This means knowing the principal persons, events, 
places, dates, and themes of the Bible; using primary sources in interpretation; interpreting biblical 
concepts in the context of cultures of the biblical world.  
2.  Students will demonstrate knowledge of Christianity. This includes identifying the essential 
doctrines of the Christian faith and knowing the historical and theological developments of the 
Christian movement.  
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
 
Biblical Studies Department 
3 
May 2023 
 
3.  Guided by biblical understanding, students will demonstrate a refined Christian worldview. This 
includes evaluating culturally influenced values and beliefs; defining and articulating a global view of 
humans and cultural systems, and ways to interact appropriately with them; defining and 
articulating a holistic integration of all aspects of life—both Christian and secular—under the rule of 
God and for His honor. 
4.  Students will integrate knowledge of the Christian faith into their lives and demonstrate good 
citizenship in the Christian community and in society at large. This includes applying the great 
commandment to all relationships; applying the Great Commission to personal and cultural 
encounters and relationships; being active participants in a community of faith; and interacting with 
differing points of view by speaking the truth in love. 
PROGRAMS 
Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science Degree: 
Students completing baccalaureate studies will earn a Bachelor’s degree in any of our program majors 
listed in the following section.   
 
Master of Arts in Ministry Studies: 
 
 
The MA in Ministry Studies is a 36-hour online program designed to provide professional and practical 
training for those who are pursuing or are already involved in church ministry. This degree will prepare 
and equip ministry leaders with the necessary personal, professional, and theological training for your 
unique Christian calling within church ministry or human services.  The program goals are designed to 
augment and support the mission of Grace College and Seminary. 
 
 
The M.A. in Ministry Studies strikes a balance between foundational theological preparation and real-life 
ministry training. The program is designed to add to the body of knowledge gained in Grace’s 
undergraduate biblical studies programs and to train those who have not pursued undergraduate 
training in biblical studies for positions of support and leadership in the local church.  Note that 
graduates of the Department of Biblical Studies may gain advanced standing in Grace Theological 
Seminary. 
 
Accelerated Master of Arts Degree: Students have the opportunity to pursue a master of Arts degree in 
either Local Church Ministry or Intercultural Ministry from our residential seminary while pursuing 
their Bachelor’s degree in Biblical Studies, Intercultural Studies, Educational Ministry, Youth 
Ministry, Bible Translation, and Sports Ministry.  This accelerated degree can be completed in four 
years, with the last two years being enrolled in both the college and the seminary. 
 
Accelerated Master of Divinity Degree: Students have the opportunity to pursue a Master of Divinity 
degree while pursuing a Bachelor’s degree. This is available for the following Bachelor’s degree: 
Biblical Studies, Intercultural Studies, Educational Ministry, Youth Ministry, Bible Translation, and 
Sports Ministry.   
       Students can get their Master of Divinity concentrations in the areas of Pastoral Studies, 
Intercultural Studies, Exegetical Studies, and Pastoral Counseling. Students can complete this in five 
years and in the fifth year they are a seminary student only.

integration of theory with practice as they process the course concepts in life with others in a relational 
context of ministry.

ministry settings in order to equip the learner to work more effectively with a variety of people in 
diverse settings. Through course material, individual reflection, and small group experiences, learners

roles, and conflict management skills. The focus of this course contains principles for evaluating 
relational maturity, elements that help and hinder spiritual community and skills for dealing with conflict 
in healthy ways utilizing effective communication skills necessary for personal and ministerial 
development. Three units.

MIN 5110 Equipping Other for Ministry 
Equipping others for ministry is a part of our calling from God (Eph. 4:11-13). But how do we work with 
others so that we reach maturity together? This course will help you see that ministry is not just about 
doing the ministry yourself, but teaching others to join you in various arenas of ministry. You will learn 
about God’s equipping ministry in your own life, and be challenged to imitate His methods of entrusting 
others with redemptive work through His Spirit. The class will explore various methods of equipping 
others, including mentoring, coaching and modeling, and will address the challenges of recruiting, 
training and retaining volunteers or key staff members. Three hours.

context of ministry.  Three hours.   
 
MIN 5820 Soul Care in Leadership

trying to fix others in pain, soul care attempts to incarnate the presence of God in the life of another and 
allow God to use you to be his hands and feet. Part of this process is learning how to listen to the Spirit 
of God and attend to another in the midst of their journey. The learner will have the opportunity to see 
and reject patterns of self-talk (based on the flesh) in order to embrace Spirit-led patterns of soul talk. 
The care of souls is an interpersonal part of ministry leadership that often gets overlooked in our 
program-driven church context. This class will help to equip ministry leaders in their role as shepherd to 
the flock entrusted to their care.  Three hours.

ABOUT GRACE THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY 
A Rich History                                                                                         
Grace College Theological Seminary had its beginning as the result of an informal meeting in June 1937.  
Deeply concerned about the inroads of modern unbelief in higher education, a number of Brethren 
pastors and laymen came together for earnest prayer and counsel in Ashland, Ohio. The group laid plans 
for founding an institution of higher theological education where positive biblical standards of Christian 
faith and life could be established and maintained. 
The founding board called Dr. Alva J. McClain to be president of this new institution, Grace Theological 
Seminary. He brought to this position high attainment of scholarship and wide experience as a 
successful pastor and master teacher. A competent faculty was convened, and the school opened its 
first annual session in Akron, Ohio, in the fall of 1937 with a student body of thirty-nine. Grace 
Theological Seminary received its legal charter on April 8, 1938. 
The circumstances under which the school was founded, its clear Christian testimony, and its 
educational ideals aroused widespread interest among Christian leaders and schools of like precious 
faith throughout this country. 
After the organization of the seminary, Dr. W. E. Biederwolf, Director of the Winona Lake Bible 
Conference, along with other Christian leaders, encouraged that the seminary be moved to Winona 
Lake. The administration and board agreed, and the seminary relocated in 1939.  
The seminary experienced steady growth, even during the years of World War II. New degree programs 
were offered, regional accreditation was achieved, and graduates went out to serve the Lord as pastors, 
missionaries, teachers, chaplains, and leaders in other types of Christian ministries around the world. 
Faculty members were kept busy, not only as effective classroom teachers and mentors, but also as 
visiting lecturers in other institutions, in churches, and in Bible conference ministries. The faculty of 
Grace Theological Seminary has authored scores of books, contributed many articles to scholarly and 
religious journals, and assisted in the production of Bible translations, such as the New American 
Standard Bible, the New International Version, the New King James Version, and the New Living Bible. 
In 1991 a special consortium was held with Christian ministry leaders from across the United States. As a 
result, the mission and values of the school were redrafted based on the goal of translating the 
distinctives and the unchanging doctrinal foundation into the contemporary world in which graduates 
minister. Shortly thereafter, a major revision in the Master of Divinity curriculum was implemented and 
the Doctor of Ministry program was added to provide professional education for pastors and other 
ministry leaders. 
The seminary programs are part of the Grace College School of Ministry Studies. Grace College is an 
accredited four-year liberal arts college with a strong Christian emphasis. It was under the sponsorship 
of Grace Theological Seminary that Grace College came into existence in 1948. 
Grace Theological Seminary is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central 
Association of Colleges and Schools, the Association of Theological Schools, and the Association of 
Christian Schools International. Grace Theological Seminary in cooperation with the International

Grace Theological Seminary is located in the town of Winona Lake, in north central Indiana. Situated 
near the shores of Winona Lake, one of the largest of the more than 100 lakes in Kosciusko County, the 
campus is close to a number of scenic and recreational attractions. With Chicago 120 miles to the 
northwest and Fort Wayne 40 miles to the east, easy access to these metropolitan centers is available by 
way of U.S. Highway 30. Once the home of evangelist Billy Sunday, William Jennings Bryan, James 
Whitcomb Riley, and Homer Rodeheaver, the community offers a wealth of history and tradition. It was 
the site of the historic Winona Lake Bible Conference, which for several years operated under the 
auspices of Grace College and Theological Seminary. Winona Lake is a part of the Greater Warsaw area, 
an expanding area with a healthy economy. 
Grace offers many opportunities for activities and facilities available to undergraduate, graduate, and 
seminary students. Seminarians may participate in such activities as Symphony of the Lakes, Symphonic 
Chorus, plays, intramural athletics, outreach efforts, athletic events, a student union, dining commons, 
and a sports and recreation center. 
For seminarians, Winona Lake, Warsaw, and nearby communities provide opportunities for affordable 
housing, part-time and full-time employment, and the kind of high community standards typical of the 
tradition of the Midwestern United States. In addition, the region offers ministry opportunities through 
local churches, hospital chaplain assistantships, prison ministries, and other organizations.

The seminary’s faculty and administration recognize that the right kind of spiritual atmosphere can 
neither be produced nor maintained by human mechanics or techniques. The creation of this 
atmosphere depends wholly upon the all-sufficient grace of the Lord, flowing through truly regenerated 
lives—lives that are characterized by walking in His Spirit, submitted to His will, and trusting in His 
power. Therefore, one of the seminary’s primary goals is that all institutional activities be surrounded 
with an attitude of prayer and devotion centered in Him.

Standards of Conduct 
Because of the great responsibility for modeling placed on Christian leaders, all students at Grace 
Theological Seminary are expected to maintain the highest standards of biblical conviction and conduct. 
The seminary is not a censoring agency, but expects maturing Christian convictions, concern for the 
conscience of others, and a willingness to submit to spiritual authority. Although man-made regulations 
cannot improve on the Christian’s standing in Christ, they can strengthen the life and testimony of 
individuals and the institution. Reasonable standards of conduct therefore are a necessary part of a 
spiritual community. Accordingly, the seminary’s standards of conduct include: 
1.  The highest standards of Christian conduct in all activities and relationships. In particular, students 
are expected to maintain proper family relationships and to abstain from improper sexual activities 
and emotional entanglements. 
2.  Faithfulness in Christian ministry. Each student is expected to be involved in ministry during his or 
her time of study on campus. Academic preparation does not take the place of active participation 
in the local church. 
3.  Utilization of time to the best advantage by careful study, participation in spiritual activities, faithful 
attendance in church and at school, and the discerning use of literature, movies, music, television, 
and the Internet. Because Internet pornography is known to be an increasing problem with students 
across America, and because immorality happens tragically all too often among spiritual leaders, it is 
expected that each student will make every effort, through godliness and discipline, to remain 
morally pure, including forming a same-gender accountability relationship. 
4.  Abstinence from such practices as gambling, inappropriate social dancing, identification with secret 
societies, and the use of alcoholic beverages, illegal drugs, and tobacco. 
5.  Avoidance of every form of dishonesty and deceit, including cheating on exams or assignments, 
failure to meet financial obligations promptly, and negligence in the performance of duties at one’s 
place of employment. 
6.  Conformity to certain standards of appearance and dress which are maintained in order to 
strengthen the testimony of the seminary and to promote the general morale of the school. 
Details on these matters and other policies are set forth in the Grace College and Theological Seminary 
student handbook. Grace Theological Seminary reserves the right to discipline or dismiss a student who, 
in its judgment, does not conform either to the stated regulations governing conduct or to the 
expressed principles, policies, and programs of the Seminary. 
By virtue of their enrollment, students agree to live within the framework of these standards. 
Co-curricular Activities 
The focus of the mission and educational values of Grace Theological Seminary is pursued by design 
through the regular curriculum and other co-curricular activities that impact seminary life. These co-
curricular activities are intended to further the purpose and objectives of Grace Theological Seminary in 
an environment of vital Christian fellowship, practical theological study, and ministry skill development. 
Additional information about these activities, as well as expectations for student involvement, can be 
found in the Student Handbook. These activities include: 
1.  Student Socials: at the beginning of the fall semester, the seminary sponsors a gathering for new 
students and their families as part of the new student orientation activities. This event enables new 
students and their families to make friends and to fellowship with other seminary student families 
and with faculty and their families. 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025

2.  Chapel: during the fall and spring semesters, chapels are scheduled in order to provide times for 
leadership development, spiritual refreshment, and worship. Attendance requirements are outlined 
in the Student Handbook. 
3.  Days of Worship and Prayer: one day each semester is reserved as a day of worship and prayer. 
Classes are dismissed for the day and the entire student body and faculty join together in prayer, 
praise, intercession, and testimony. It is one of the spiritually enriching experiences of the semester. 
4.  Conference on Mission: recognized missionary executives, authorities, and missionaries are brought 
to the campus to present the work of their various organizations. This is an annual conference 
sponsored by the Missions Conference Coordinating Committee. The conference is held jointly with 
the college student body. Through the conference every student is made aware of opportunities and 
responsibilities to serve people of any race or culture, locally and globally. 
5.  Mentoring Groups: students are required to become active, faithful participants of a seminary-
sponsored mentoring group during each semester in which they are enrolled for at least one 
residential class. Groups will meet at various times of the week throughout the semester in an 
attempt to accommodate students’ varying schedules. Any exceptions to this requirement must 
receive official approval from the Dean of the School of Ministry Studies. Information is available at 
the Seminary Administrative Office. 
Admissions, Expenses, and Financial Aid 
General Admission Policies 
In addition to the policies listed below, for admission to the Doctor of Ministry program please refer to 
the Doctor of Ministry section in this catalog for specific admission guidelines that apply. 
The basic requirement for entrance into the master’s degree programs is a four-year bachelor’s degree, 
or its equivalent (for international students), from a recognized institution of higher learning. Graduates 
of Bible colleges, liberal arts colleges, and state colleges and universities are encouraged to apply. 
Those who are planning to obtain a bachelor’s degree in preparation for seminary are encouraged to 
include both a broad exposure to general education subjects and English Bible courses in their 
undergraduate studies. 
Students able to take Greek or Hebrew language studies at the undergraduate level should note the 
possibilities for advanced standing that such a course of study offers. Students already having a four-
year degree without the opportunity to pursue some of the suggested pre-seminary curriculum are 
encouraged to do some reading in preparation for seminary. However, the seminary program is 
designed to allow students to gain a solid biblical foundation for future ministry without pre-seminary 
educational preparation. 
A student who received his or her pre-seminary education at an institution which is not accredited or 
who achieved less than a 2.5 grade point average in pre-seminary education may be admitted on 
academic restriction. 
Admission Requirement 
Since the various curricula and courses of the seminary are designed for those who are capable of 
undertaking a graduate standard of work, the usual academic requirement for admission is evidence of 
satisfactory completion of a four-year accredited college or university bachelor’s program or the 
equivalent. Grace has a policy in place for assessing those who have not completed a four-year degree 
and for those who have a non-accredited four year degree. 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary

May 2023 
In no case, however, will the seminary regard mere academic achievement or high intellectual ability as 
sufficient to justify admission. There are certain spiritual, moral, and personal qualifications without 
which any attempt to prepare for the ministry of the gospel can result in nothing but personal tragedy. 
The seminary administration, therefore, will regard these matters as proper subjects for investigation in 
all cases and reserves the right to withdraw the privileges of the school from those who after admission 
may prove to be lacking in these necessary qualifications. 
Each applicant is assured of careful consideration regardless of his or her denomination, race, or 
national origin. 
Students who are divorced, remarried after a divorce or married to a divorced spouse will be considered 
for admission to Grace Theological Seminary. However, additional information and a reference from a 
pastor acquainted with the situation may be requested. 
Application Materials 
All students considering entrance to the seminary should make formal application as early as possible in 
order to get full consideration for financial aid. Financial aid awards are made according to established 
deadlines. Students applying for financial aid are encouraged to contact the Office of Financial Aid in 
order to obtain the most recent information on what financial aid is available and the deadlines for 
financial aid applications. 
An online application may be found on the Grace Web site (www.grace.edu/admissions/apply/). An 
application packet may be secured from the Office of Graduate and Adult Enrollment. The packet 
includes complete instructions on application procedures. Materials to be submitted to apply for 
admission include: 
1.  The application form with all applicable questions answered in full, including an attached written 
testimony of the student’s conversion and spiritual growth over the past few years 
2.  A Spiritual Reference form 
3.  In some cases, applicants will need a Ministry Reference 
4.  Official transcripts from all colleges and/or seminaries attended 
5.  TOEFL scores (international students only) 
In most cases the applicant will be notified of his or her admission status within one week after all 
application materials have been received by the Director of Seminary Admissions. The Admissions 
Committee may grant admission on the basis of the credentials named above, may request the applicant 
to submit additional materials, or ask the applicant to interview with the Dean of the Seminary or 
another representative of the Seminary. 
Advanced Standing 
Advanced standing is available at Grace Theological Seminary for students who have prepared 
themselves in their undergraduate training for seminary studies. Grace recognizes the level of training 
and study completed at many accredited Bible colleges and Christian liberal arts colleges. Advanced 
standing will enable students to build on their previous education rather than repeat it. This means that 
they will spend less time and less money on their seminary training and more time in ministry.  
A maximum of 25% of credit hours required for the degree may be earned through Advanced Standing 
for those entering the Master of Arts or Master of Divinity degree programs (a maximum of 33% is 
allowed for students in the Accelerated Program). Classes that are allowed to count for advanced 
standing will be determined by the faculty and the Dean of Grace Theological Seminary by comparing 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
8 
May 2023 
undergraduate transcripts with the student’s chosen program of study.  In addition to an examination of 
the student’s transcripts, the following must also take place for advanced standing to be awarded:    
• 
The student must have completed his/her undergraduate studies at an approved school. 
•  The student must have achieved a “B-” or better in the course for which advanced standing is 
granted (for Deploy, a “B” or better is required). 
•  The student must successfully pass the advanced standing examination (when applicable) for 
selected courses at Grace Theological Seminary. 
 
 
NOTE: No Advanced Standing may be awarded toward the Master of Ministry Studies Online program. 
 
It is important to note that students applying for advanced standing credit must do so through the Office 
of the Dean of the Seminary within the first 8 weeks of initial enrollment after they have been officially 
admitted to Grace Theological Seminary.  
Transfer Credits 
In the case of transfers from other seminaries with proper academic standards, students will ordinarily 
be given full credit for work satisfactorily completed up to one-half of the credit hours required for the 
degree program at Grace in which they are enrolled. Courses transferred in must be substantially 
equivalent to Grace courses that are part of the student’s chosen program, or permission must be 
granted by the Dean of the Seminary to allow the courses to be used as electives. Credit hours gained 
through advanced standing reduce the number of transfer hours allowed.  The transfer credit limit may 
be waived for students internally transferring from one Grace College & Theological Seminary program 
into another Grace College & Theological Seminary program. Any exceptions granted must be for 
courses of substantially similar academic content and require approval from the Dean and Faculty of the 
Seminary, as well as the Registrar. Students will be permitted only one program change.  
NOTE: The Transfer Credit limit for the Master of Ministry Studies Online program is 9 credits. 
In the case where a student has an earned master’s degree from another seminary with proper 
academic standards, credit from that program will be accepted toward the Master of Divinity degree 
based on the following guidelines: 
1.  Students with an M.A. degree (including those from Grace College & Theological Seminary) can use 
up to the 36-hour limit to meet requirements for the M.Div. degree. 
2.    Students with the M.A. degree can apply credit to other master’s programs at Grace College &     
Theological Seminary only in the amount allowed under the transfer guidelines established (with 
Deploy requiring a “B” or better for transfer credit). 
It is important to note that students applying for transfer credit must do so through the Office of the 
Dean of the Seminary within the first 8 weeks of initial enrollment after they have been officially 
admitted to Grace Theological Seminary.  
International Students 
Students from other countries who have completed a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent with a high 
academic standing are encouraged to apply to the seminary. Such students should be aware, however, 
that the seminary has limited scholarships and no living subsidies for international students. In addition 
to the normal application procedures, applicants from other countries must meet the following 
requirements: 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
9 
May 2023 
1.  A full application is submitted with all the appropriate accompanying material. With the regular 
materials the student must also supply a certificate showing evidence that he or she has adequate 
resources for his or her own program of studies in the United States as well as for any dependents, 
whether they come with the student or remain at home. If the applicant is unable to certify that he 
or she has personal funding adequate for such purposes, he or she must secure a statement from 
some responsible organization or individual willing to guarantee the support and care of the 
dependents, as well as the round-trip tickets and educational and living expenses while in the 
United States. Grace Theological Seminary will not issue the Certificate of Eligibility (Form I-20) until 
it receives and approves the completed Financial Certificate guaranteeing these funds, all 
application materials, and the advance $50.00 payment on tuition and fees. 
 
2.  An applicant whose native language is other than English must complete the Test of English as a 
Foreign Language (TOEFL), unless he or she has obtained an accredited bachelor’s degree at an 
English-speaking institution. The TOEFL is a standard test offered at testing centers throughout the 
world. Information about the test can be obtained by contacting the Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) directly at: TOEFL Services, Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, New Jersey 
08541-6151, USA; or contact TOEFL Services on the Web at www.toefl.org, by E-mail toefl@ets.org, 
or by telephone at 609.711.7500. 
Grace Theological Seminary reserves the right to require students to add English courses to their 
program of study if deemed necessary. A minimum score of 560 (220 computer-based, 83 Internet-
based) on the TOEFL is required for admission to Grace Theological Seminary. TOEFL scores should be 
mailed directly to Grace Theological Seminary by ETS. Our institutional code is 1252. Results will be 
mailed to the Seminary Admissions Office by placing this code in the appropriate place on the test 
registration form. 
Tuition Deposit 
A $100 advance payment on tuition and fees is required of all new students upon receipt of their letter 
of acceptance and before registration for classes. This payment should be directed to the Office of 
Graduate and Adult Enrollment. If the student decides to withdraw his or her admission and notifies the 
Office of Graduate and Adult Enrollment, refunds on tuition will be made according to a schedule 
established by the Business Office. The Business Office may be contacted for details. 
Student Intent 
The accepted student will be asked to give their intent to study at GTS. This process will be completed 
electronically from their Status Portal. This will signify the student’s intention to enroll at Grace 
Theological Seminary and will verify the intended program of study.  
Medical Insurance 
Students at the time of registration are strongly encouraged to have secured medical insurance 
coverage for themselves and all dependents. This stands as an ethical obligation of students that may 
only become apparent at a time of greatest need. Students are urged to handle this matter with the 
highest degree of integrity. For further information contact the Grace Schools Health Center. 
Electronic Media Requirement 
Our desire as a faculty and administration is to do a good job of communicating to our students. This is 
becoming increasingly challenging because of the diverse mix that constitutes our student body (e.g. 
residential students, non-traditional students, part-time and full-time students). In response, we intend 
to use modern electronic media (electronic bulletin boards, Web pages, and e-mail) to communicate 
information to students. As a result, we are expecting students to have access to the Internet (for 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
10 
May 2023 
connecting to electronic bulletin boards and Web pages and for accessing e-mail). Further, we are 
requiring all students to be familiar with their Grace Theological Seminary e-mail address and to check 
that address frequently (for mass e-mailings). Students who neglect to check their Grace e-mail account 
regularly can expect to miss important school and class announcements which can possibly have a 
negative effect on their program of study. Our desire as a faculty is to provide training for students in 
the use of electronic tools for Bible study, exegetical investigation, sermon preparation, etc. Therefore, 
we are requiring that each student have access to a personal computer so that they might use the 
various electronic tools that are available for a variety of disciplines. In addition, students may be asked 
to purchase software, in conjunction with certain classes, much as they are asked to purchase books for 
classes. 
Expenses for All Programs 
Grace Theological Seminary seeks to provide a quality theological education for all its students. Tuition 
charges paid by the student cover only a portion of the cost of operating the seminary program. Gifts 
and grants from individual friends, corporations, and interested churches meet the balance of the 
expenses. Current tuition rates and fees are available from the Grace Schools Business Office or on the 
Grace Web site: http://ww.grace.edu/resources/business-office#graduatecosts 
Terms of Payment for Regular Semesters 
Grace Theological Seminary provides two payment plans for its courses: (NOTE: These payment options 
are not available to D.Min/DICS students. D.Min/DICS seminary fees must be paid in full during the week 
of class.) 
Option 1: Pay all semester charges in full two weeks prior to the first day of class of the semester. 
Payment is made to the Student Services Hub, or you may pay online at portal.grace.edu under the 
‘Student’ tab. NelNet is our online payment service. Visa, Master Card, and Discover credit cards are also 
accepted. 
Option 2: Grace also offers a longer-term payment plans through NelNet. This plan allows the student 
the option of making up to 5 monthly payments to pay off the balance by semester end. The cost of this 
plan is a $45 semester enrollment fee. You can also contact NelNet at 800-609-8056. One of the above 
plans must be chosen since no other payment plans are available. 
Please note that interest on my account will be charged each month at the rate of 1.5% (18% annually) 
on any unpaid balance from the previous month. (Unless contracted through NelNet) 
Federal Refund Policy 
If a student changes his/her total credit hours for a semester by dropping a class or classes, or officially 
withdrawing on or before the 60% point in time of the period of enrollment, calculated using calendar 
days, a portion of the total of Title IV funds awarded a student (Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford 
Loan, Federal PLUS Loan, but not Federal Work Study) must be returned according to the provisions of 
the Higher Education Amendments of 1998. The calculation of the return of these funds may result in 
the student owing a balance to Grace and/or the Federal government. Questions may be directed to the 
Office of Financial Aid. 
Institutional Refund Policy  
Full refund on tuition and fees will be given for classes dropped the first week of the semester session. 
Tuition refunds for students withdrawing entirely from school will be based on the official date of action 
that was recorded by the Registrar’s office. It is the student’s responsibility to file the proper paperwork 
within the week class(es) are dropped in order to receive maximum refund as per the published refund

schedule.  A student who is dropping a class or withdrawing completely from school must go to the 
Registrar’s Office to complete the proper forms. Upon withdrawing from Grace, a pro-rated refund of 
both charges and financial aid will occur based on the official date of such action. Federal regulations 
specify that, should a student withdraw from an institution, any amount of a refund must be returned to 
the Title IV programs funds first, up to the full amounts received.

Note to Students receiving student loans:  Graduate students must be enrolled at least half-time in 
order to be eligible for a student loan. Half-time for the seminary means at least three credit hours.  A 
student loan will only be disbursed once it is certain that a student will be enrolled for the minimum 
credits for half-time.  If a student is taking at least three credit hours of class work during the first 
session of the semester, the loan will be disbursed in week 2 of the first session. 
Note to Deploy students: Week 1 and Week 2 refund %s are based on students’ start dates. 
Student Housing 
Students ordinarily must make their own living arrangements, often able to rent houses or apartments 
in the community. You may check our monthly rent guide on the Grace portal -  
https://portal.grace.edu/ICS/Campus_Life/   For those who do not desire to cook, meals are available at 
Alpha Dining Commons. Information may be secured through the Food Services Office. 
Student Financial Aid 
Loan programs such as Federal Stafford, and the Direct Federal Loan Policy are available to students 
who qualify. 
The application process for financial aid is as follows:

Grace Theological Seminary Federal School Code is 001800. 
Students are notified on a rolling basis of their financial aid eligibility upon admission to the seminary 
and completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). However, the preferred 
deadline for fall semester is June 1. Awards are based on the funding available at the time of the award. 
It is in the student’s best interest to apply for admission and financial aid as early as possible. Financial 
aid awards will not be offered until the applicant has been officially accepted. A student must be 
enrolled in four or more credit hours per semester to be considered for federal student aid. 
In addition, students must be making satisfactory academic progress to receive institutional and/or 
federal student aid. 
Scholarship and Loan Programs 
In order to assist worthy and qualified students, Grace Theological Seminary provides supplemental 
financial support through institutional scholarships and federal loan programs. Students enrolled in 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
12 
May 2023 
master’s programs may qualify for Grace Theological Seminary scholarships and grants. Some of Grace 
Theological Seminary’s financial aid programs include: 
Grace Theological Seminary Scholarship (GTS) The GTS scholarship program is available to all Seminary

credit hour for Grace Brethren members and $50 per credit hour for non-Grace Brethren members. 
(When applied to Deploy, scholarship money is applied monthly and amounts vary.) Eligibility may be 
affected by other types of financial aid received.  It is the student’s responsibility to report errors to the 
Office of Financial Aid. The Office of Financial Aid reserves the right to make adjustments to the 
scholarship amount in the event of an over-award. Continuing students must be in good standing with 
GTS financially and academically. A thank you note must be completed in the Advancement Office of 
each academic year the student receives the benefit. Applications are due by August 24 for the fall 
semester and January 1 for the spring semester. Application is found on the website. 
 
Shepherd’s Endowment Seminary Apprenticeship Scholarship: The Shepherd’s Endowment scholarship 
program is available to Seminary students enrolled in a Master’s program of 48 hours or more. It will 
provide a $50 per credit hour for all students registered for Local Church or Intercultural Apprenticeship

Financial Aid reserves the right to make adjustments to the scholarship amount in the event of an over-
award. Application is found on the website. 
 
GBIF Forgivable Loan Scholarship: Prospective Seminary students interested in serving with the Charis 
Fellowship are encouraged to apply for a forgivable loan sponsored by Grace Financial, formerly known 
as the Grace Brethren Investment Foundation (GBIF). Deploy students who receive the GBIF Forgivable 
Loan Scholarship are ineligible for receiving additional Deploy Scholarships from Grace. Students who 
receive the GBIF Forgivable Loan Scholarship must commit to serving in a Charis Fellowship ministry for 
a specified number of years after graduation based; expected years of service is based on the 
scholarship amounts received.  These funds will cover up to a third of a student’s total costs for their 
degree program.  Face-to-face or phone interviews can be scheduled with the Seminary Office Manager 
via email or by phone at 800-544-7223, ext. 6437.   
 
The Deploy Scholarship: All Deploy students are eligible to apply for the Deploy scholarship. 
Scholarships are awarded based on availability of scholarship funds. Deploy students must remain in 
good academic standing in order to receive and retain this scholarship. The Deploy scholarship 
contributes $250/month (up to $1000/semester) toward Deploy students’ tuition. This scholarship is 
prorated by months (billing months) of enrollment, and is applied on a semester basis. The scholarship 
application is available to Deploy students during the new student paperwork process.  
 
Church Matching Program is a program which provides sponsoring churches with a means of 
encouraging and assisting students attending Grace College and Theological Seminary. Churches are 
eligible regardless of denomination or affiliation. Grace Theological Seminary will match the church 
scholarship dollar for dollar up to $500.00 per student per academic year ($250 per semester), excluding 
Deploy students who are receiving either the Deploy Scholarship or GBIF Forgivable Loan Scholarship.  
To be eligible, a student is required to be a half-time student in a two or three year program, taking at

Terms of Payment for Summer School 
All charges for summer school classes are to be paid in full by the first day of the summer school session. 
Responsibility for Payments 
Because of the various federal privacy laws, Grace Theological Seminary has adopted the policy of 
dealing directly with the student on all matters relating to a student’s account. No direct billings will be 
sent to any third party unless arrangements have been made with the Business Office. 
Service Charge 
Any student account with a past due balance will be subject to a monthly service charge of 1.5 percent 
of the account balance. 
Registration for Courses 
With the exception of new students, each student is expected to register for the following semester’s 
classes at the designated time (approximately one month prior to the end of the current semester.) For 
the student who is continuing studies, failure to accomplish registration by the close of the current 
semester may result in a $100.00 late fee being charged to the student’s account. 
Drops/Adds of Classes 
A student may add a class anytime during the first three days of classes in each session of a semester, 
though the process and timeline for Deploy students differs from other Seminary programs due to the 
competency-based nature of the program. Deploy students may add competency modules (courses) 
throughout the semester. Deploy students who wish to add competency modules mid-semester must 
work through their Student Support Manager who will then officially register them for additional 
modules.  A student who decides to drop a class (or classes) in which he or she is registered at Grace 
Theological Seminary, may do so during the first week of each session of the semester. For Deploy 
students, the drop period different (by the end of week 5 for returning students and by the end of week 
10 for new students). 
Drops during the first week of class for each session will result in complete erasure of the dropped 
class(es) from the student’s transcript. (Deploy students have a designated drop period beyond this first 
week during which they can also drop a class resulting in complete erasure of the class from their 
transcript. Deploy students in their first semester of enrollment may drop competency modules through 
the end of week 10 without academic policy. All other Deploy students may drop competency modules 
through the end of week 5 without academic penalty.) Drops by the date designated on the academic 
calendar as “last day to withdraw from classes with ‘W’” will result in a “W” on the student’s transcript. 
Failure to drop a class(es) that is not attended will result in an “F” appearing on the student’s transcript 
for each class(es).  Following the first week of classes for each session, there will be no refund of tuition 
if a class is dropped. See the refund schedule above for more details. 
 
Students wishing to drop a course are always encouraged to contact the Financial Aid Office to 
understand the financial ramifications of the decision. Students bear responsibility for the implications 
of dropping or withdrawing from courses.  
 
Withdrawal from Grace Theological Seminary 
Students who desire to discontinue their studies at Grace Theological Seminary are required to officially 
withdraw from the Seminary. A Withdrawal Form may be found on the Grace Portal. This completed 
form should be filed with the Registrar upon the decision to withdraw from Grace Theological Seminary. 
Official Withdrawal Forms filed during the first week of the semester will completely erase the 
semester’s courses from the student’s transcript. (Deploy students have a designated drop period 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
14 
May 2023 
beyond this first week during which they can also withdraw resulting in complete erasure of the 
semester’s courses from their transcript. This timeline extends to week 5 for returning Deploy students 
and week 10 for first-semester Deploy students.) Withdrawals filed by the date designated on the 
Academic Calendar as “last day to withdraw from classes with ‘W’” will result in a “W” for each class of 
the semester on the student’s transcript. Withdrawing after the last “W” date or failure to submit a 
Withdrawal Form will result in an “F” for each class in which the student is registered for that semester.  
Students wishing to withdraw from a course or from the Seminary are encouraged to contact the 
Financial Aid Office to understand the financial ramifications of the decision.

C+ (77-79)    Clearly average work.  Evidences an average level of interest, work ethic, research  
C   (73-76)    energy and technique, attentiveness and responsiveness in class, thinking capacities, 
C-  (70-72)    and literacy in the subject matter.

                        subject matter. 
 
F   (0-59)     Not doing passing work.  The student evidences a lack of interest, an absence of  
                      effort, no energy expended in assignments, and an insufficient literacy in the  
                      subject matter. 
 
The grading scale is offered only as a guideline. It may vary with individual faculty members and 
individual courses. Faculty members have the prerogative of adjusting grades at their discretion. 
 
*Deploy, Grace’s Competency-Based Master’s Program, utilizes an alternative grading scale that 
generally follows the percentages of the traditional scale. Module grades are based on the cumulative 
average of the students’ Mastery Assessments. Students must receive an 83% or above to pass each 
Mastery Assessment and, thus, the module. Competency grades are based on the cumulative average of 
all module grades for that particular competency. Students must achieve an 83% or above on each 
competency in order to pass. See the Module and Competency grading scales below.

Dropping a Class 
A grade of “W” indicates that the student has dropped (withdrawn) from the course before the deadline 
established by the academic calendar as the last day to withdraw with a “W”. Dropping a class or 
withdrawal from school after that time automatically results in the grade of “F”. The Dean of the 
Seminary may grant permission for a grade of “W” after the established deadline due to unusual 
circumstances. (Deploy students have a designated drop period beyond the first week during which they 
can drop a class resulting in complete erasure of the class from their transcript. Deploy students in their 
first semester of enrollment may drop competency modules through the end of week 10—calculated 
from the start of the semester—without academic penalty. All other Deploy students may drop 
competency modules through the end of week 5—calculated from the start of the semester—without 
academic penalty.)

Student Status 
Students who enroll in any degree program are expected to register for each succeeding semester until 
graduation from that program. A student who does not register for classes during any semester 
regularly scheduled for his or her program must complete a Readmittance Form in order to register for 
courses following the break in the program.  
A student who does not register for classes for two consecutive semesters that are regularly scheduled 
for his or her program must complete an “Readmittance Form” and may be required to submit an 
additional “Pastoral Reference Form” in order to register for courses again.  
Any student who does not register for more than two consecutive semesters that are regularly 
scheduled for his or her program must completely reapply to Grace Theological Seminary. (Doctoral 
students are exempted from these guidelines). 
Those students who, for any reason, are breaking their program of study for a limited period of time 
must bear responsibility to seek pre-registration materials for subsequent semesters, as well as general 
information about seminary activities. Schedules of classes may be viewed on the Grace Web site. 
Materials will not be placed in non-active student mailboxes or sent to them by the school. Non-active 
students, however, remain on the seminary student e-mail list for one semester and will receive some 
information by that means. 
Incompletes 
A grade of “I” (Incomplete) may be given at the discretion of the Dean of the School of Ministry Studies 
only under unusual circumstances to indicate that the work done has been of passing grade, but that a 
small portion is incomplete for some excusable reason. Excusable reasons include family emergencies or 
extended, debilitating illness. This mark must be removed by meeting the requirements of the teacher 
prior to the deadline following the end of the semester (dates are noted on the academic calendar) or 
the incomplete automatically becomes a failure (”F”). No graduating student may receive an extension 
or incomplete (“I”) for any course taken during the semester in which he or she intends to graduate. Due 
to the nature of the Deploy program, Deploy students do not qualify for grades of “I” (Incomplete) 
except under special circumstances, as granted at the discretion of the Director of Deploy. 
Grade Point Average (GPA) 
Grade points are awarded according to the following scale: 
A 
4.000* 
B- 
2.667

*Points for each semester hour of course work. 
A grade point average of 2.0 is required for satisfactory completion of the Certificate or Diploma 
programs.  
Candidates for the Master’s programs must attain a grade point average of 2.5 for the entire course of 
study. A 3.0 grade point average is required for Deploy and D.Min. degrees. 
Repeating Courses 
Students may repeat courses taken previously at Grace Theological Seminary. When a course is 
repeated, the most current grade will be used to calculate the current and cumulative grade point 
average. However, as a matter of record, the original grade must remain on the student’s transcript. The 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025

grade to be replaced by the repeat will be noted with “*R” on the transcript; the repeat grade will be 
signified by “**.” This policy applies only to courses (or their equivalents) being currently offered and 
may be utilized by both current and former students. 
Academic Restriction 
Academic restriction applies to first semester students who are admitted with a restricted academic 
status as a result of a low college grade point average or graduation from an unaccredited institution. 
A student on academic restriction is limited to no more than nine credit hours for the first semester. Any 
hours above nine require the approval of the Dean of the Seminary. If the required grade point average 
is not met during the initial semester, the student will be placed on academic probation for the 
following semester. 
Academic Probation 
A student failing to complete satisfactory work will be placed on academic probation. Academic 
probation is based on the cumulative grade point average at the end of each regular semester (not 
including summer school). Academic probation for degree programs is based on the following minimum 
requirement scale: 
Credit Hours GPA 
0–9 ..................................................... 2.0 
10–19 ............................................... 2.25 
20-25 ........................................ 2.50/2.37 
36–48. ...................................... 2.37/2.50  
Over 49 ............................................ 2.50 
Deploy and Doctor of Ministry students must maintain for each semester the grade point average 
required for graduation. Diploma and certificate students must maintain a grade point average of 2.0 or 
above. Transfer students must obtain the appropriate grade point average for their program during their 
initial semester to avoid academic probation. 
A student on probation is expected to improve his or her grade point average each semester until 
reaching the minimum required GPA. The student will remain on academic probation provided that his 
or her grade point average is improving until reaching the minimum required GPA. Failure to make 
progress toward the minimum GPA standards will require that he or she be placed on final academic 
probation. 
Final Academic Probation 
A student on academic probation is placed on final academic probation when his or her grade point 
average for the semester falls below the established scale. He or she is not permitted to take more than 
nine credit hours during a semester without written permission from the Dean of the Seminary. 
The following students may be placed on final academic probation at the discretion of the Dean of the 
Seminary: 
1.  Regularly admitted students who in their initial semester at Grace Theological Seminary obtain a 
grade point average of less than 1.0. 
2.  Regularly admitted transfer students who in their initial semester at Grace Theological Seminary 
obtain a grade point average .500 less than the requirement for their credit hours GPA classification. 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
18 
May 2023 
3.  Any student who accumulates a grade point average that is .500 less than the requirement for his or 
her credit hours GPA classification. 
Students may appeal the decision to the Dean of the Seminary. 
At the conclusion of the final probation semester, a student failing to raise his or her grade point 
average to the appropriate level may be dropped for poor scholarship. Any student who enters the 
spring semester of their final year on final academic probation should not expect to graduate in the 
spring semester. 
Students who have been dropped for academic reasons are declared ineligible to return to school for 
one year. If the student is deemed eligible for readmission, the Admissions Committee, in consultation 
with the Dean of the Seminary, will establish a written agreement between the institution and the 
readmittee. The student is required to earn a designated grade point average as determined by the 
committee. Whatever the established grade point average, it must be earned each semester by the 
readmittee or he or she may be dropped for the second and final time. 
Limited Academic Program 
If a student is dismissed from Grace Theological Seminary because of low academic achievement, that 
student may be placed on a part-time program of six credit hours or less at the discretion of the Dean of 
the Seminary. In order to be admitted to this limited academic program, the student must appeal to the 
Vice President and Dean of the Seminary after being dismissed from seminary. During the semester(s) 
that the student is in the limited academic program, he or she must continue to show academic 
improvement. If the cumulative grade point average does not show continued improvement, the 
student will be dismissed at the end of the semester. 
Under this program a student can raise his or her grade point average to the level required for 
readmission to regular status. 
Graduating with Academic Honors 
Policy:  Students are awarded academic honors based on GPA requirements specified for each academic 
program and if they have completed at least half their degree credits at Grace College and/or 
Theological Seminary.  Adult, graduate, and seminary programs are awarded honors and are recognized 
as a group at Commencement.  Students with GPAs of 3.75 or higher on a 4.0 scale are designated as 
Honors Graduates.  
Application for Graduation 
All students are to be in contact with their academic advisor once a semester to review their progress 
toward program requirements, total hours, and GPA. At approximately the midpoint of the semester 
prior to the seminary student’s final semester, students must make an appointment with their advisor to 
perform a graduation audit. 
Each student pursuing a degree must take full responsibility for meeting graduation requirements. This 
includes all information in this catalog and the Student Handbook, counseling with an advisor, and being 
familiar with the policy outlining graduation requirements. All candidates must complete an “Application 
for Graduation.” This form may be found at the Grace Theological Seminary Web site 
(http://gts.grace.edu) and must be filed with the Registrar by the end of the fall semester of the school 
year in which the student plans to graduate. Applications made after the end of the fall semester will be 
considered late and a $150.00 late fee will be charged to the student.

Classification of Students 
1. Full-time Students: Full-time students are those enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate 
program for at least six semester hours of credit during a regular semester.    
2. Part-time Students: Part-time students are those enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate 
program for fewer than six hours of credit during a regular semester. International doctoral degree 
students achieve full-time status by taking eight semester hours of credit during a regular semester. 
3. Unclassified Students: Unclassified students are those who are not pursuing a program (Master’s, 
Certificate or Diploma) for a degree. Unclassified students are restricted to a cumulative total of no 
more than 12 credit hours. If an unclassified student desires to take more than 12 hours at Grace 
Theological Seminary or to pursue a program for a degree, he or she must make formal application 
to the Seminary Admissions Office. A student who qualifies for the D.Min. program may complete 
up to two D.Min. classes (six hours) as an unclassified student before he or she has been fully 
accepted into the program. 
4. Auditors:  Pastors, missionaries, other Christian workers, and spouses of seminary students who 
desire to hear the lectures in a course without undertaking the coursework for credit may be 
admitted as auditors to selected courses by making proper application with the Seminary 
Admissions Office. Though no credits or grade points are involved, auditors are required to pay the 
appropriate fees and to meet class attendance requirements. Those who do not meet attendance 
requirements will receive the “grade” of “W,” whether or not they have officially withdrawn. 
Auditing is not permitted for some courses. (This policy is at the discretion of the department or 
professor involved.) For some courses, auditing is permitted only if the student completes the course 
assignments as specified by the professor. An auditor may enroll for only one semester as a “full-time” 
auditor (12 hours or more).  
A spouse of a student taking a seminary course for credit may sit in classes without registering as an 
auditor provided that the permission of the instructor has been secured in advance. 
Class Scheduling 
Many seminary classes are block scheduled so that they will meet only one or two days per week. This 
system offers an advantage for pastors or others who must commute some distance. This makes it 
possible to take a significant class load even when it is difficult to be on campus for more than one or 
two days per week. 
Residential students are permitted to take up to a certain number of courses online if they are available 
(6 MDiv, 4 MA). If a student is interested in registering for an online course they must first contact Lane 
Lingofelter, Director of School of Ministry Accelerated/Blended Program, lingofla@grace.edu to verify 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
21 
May 2023 
that the course is available for registration. Priority registration will be given to MAMS students 
currently enrolled in the program, unless the required course is only offered as an online option for 
residential students. Note: Online classes are charged an additional tech fee per class.  
Attendance Requirements 
All students are expected to be faithful in class attendance. Students are required to attend chapels, 
days of worship and prayer, and other seminary meetings as defined in the Student Handbook. 
Advising 
Each student pursuing a program or a degree will be assigned a faculty advisor. Although the Seminary 
attempts to provide adequate academic advising, ultimate responsibility for meeting all deadlines and 
all program and graduation requirements rests with the student. 
Course Numbering System 
The numbering system for courses indicates their relative sequence and the semester in which the 
course is usually offered. The alphabetical part of the system indicates the department, program, or 
subject area as follows: 
TH—Christian Theology & Church History 
OT—Old Testament Studies 
NT—New Testament Studies 
PM—Pastoral Studies and Christian Ministry Studies 
MI—Intercultural Studies and World Mission Studies 
PM 8000 level— Doctor of Ministry Track Courses (D.Min.): Advanced Expository Preaching; 
Intercultural Studies; Ministry Leadership; Pastoral Studies; Interdisciplinary Studies  
DLC— Deploy Masters of Arts in Local Church Ministry Courses 
DGM— Deploy Masters of Divinity in General Ministry Courses 
DI 8000 level—Doctor of Intercultural Studies Courses (DICS) 
 
Course Schedules 
A schedule of courses to be offered in a given semester or summer session is put on the Grace 
Theological Seminary Web site (http://gts.grace.edu) in advance of each registration. The seminary 
reserves the right to withdraw any scheduled course for which the enrollment is not sufficient to 
warrant the organization of a class. 
ACADEMIC PROGRAMS 
Grace Theological Seminary offers degree programs leading to various master’s degrees, the Doctor of 
Ministry (D.Min.) degree, and the Doctor of Intercultural Studies (DICS) degree. The master’s degrees 
are the M.A. in Christian Ministry, with concentrations in Local Church Ministry, Intercultural Studies, 
Chaplaincy, Women’s Leadership and Worship Leadership. The M.Div. includes emphases in Pastoral 
Studies, Intercultural Studies, Exegetical Studies, Chaplaincy Studies, Christian Ministry Studies, General 
Studies, Women’s Leadership, and Pastoral Counseling. Each master’s level program requires 
apprenticeships that are designed to train students in local ministry or intercultural contexts.

MASTER OF ARTS IN MINISTRY STUDIES ONLINE PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 
Purpose of the Program 
To assist in the theological training of staff and personnel for leadership in church. The program strikes a 
balance between foundational theological preparation and real-life ministry training. The program is 
designed to add to the body of knowledge gained in Grace’s undergraduate biblical studies programs 
and to train those who have not pursued undergraduate training in biblical studies for positions of 
support and leadership in the local church. Note that graduates of the Department of Biblical Studies 
may gain advanced standing in Grace Theological Seminary. 
Program Description 
The MA in Ministry Studies is a 36-hour online program designed to provide professional and practical 
training for those who are pursing or are already involved in church ministry. This degree will prepare 
and equip ministry leaders with the necessary personal, professional, and theological training for your 
unique Christian calling within church ministry or human services.  The program goals are designed to 
augment and support the mission of Grace College and Seminary. 
Program Goals and Assessment 
The program goals are designed to augment and support the mission of Grace College, which is: 
An evangelical Christian community of higher education which applies biblical values in 
strengthening character, sharpening competence, and preparing for service  
It also supports and promotes the purpose of the School of Ministry Studies, which is: 
A learning community dedicated to teaching, training, and transforming the whole person for local 
church and global ministry. 
The goals of the M.A. in Ministry Studies are that those who complete the degree will:   
1. Engage a process of critical evaluation of personal character, and cultural awareness needed to 
effectively lead in a ministry context. 
2. Be challenged to sharpen the competencies needed to interpret, understand, and effectively 
communicate the Word of God in a ministry context.   
3. Apply the knowledge gained throughout the program by engaging in real ministry directed 
learning tasks that demonstrate a preparation for service and apprehension of the principles 
and practices needed for effective ministry leadership.

Learning Outcomes 
Learners will journal the practice of prayer in the context of personal, married, and ministry life 
recording progress in the discipline of prayer as part of the character of a ministry leader (G1) 
1. Learners will develop a biblically consistent theological commitment in light of Christian 
discipleship, theology and orthodoxy. 
2. Learners will demonstrate sound biblical interpretation of a passage of Scripture for delivery in a 
ministry setting. 
3. Learners will construct a personal theology which will be able to be used as a means of 
demonstrating a firm grasp of the nature of God, man, sin, salvation, ministry, and the future. 
4. Learners will demonstrate godly leadership in ministry by gaining a sharpened awareness of current 
church needs, administration and cultural sensitivity. 
 
On a yearly basis faculty will evaluate the embedded elements of this assessment to determine the 
effectiveness and level of mastery of those elements to the program.  A full assessment program has 
been developed with rubrics to measure the success of each element contained in the 
program.  Information will be used to better construct learning activities to ensure that each student is 
prepared for ministry in their particular field. 
Schedule 
The M.A. in Ministry Studies Online offers four concentrations: Christian Ministry, Counseling, 
Technology, and Women’s Leadership Studies. The M.A. in Ministry Studies uses a modified cohort 
model. Courses are offered on a two-year rotation beginning in the fall. Students are automatically 
registered for their first session of classes. Students will self-register for all additional sessions. If 
students fail to register for at least one session during the fall or spring semester it will be necessary for 
them to contact the School of Professional and Online Education at 888.249.0533 or online@grace.edu.  
Students will complete twelve (12) 3-credit courses for a total of thirty-six (36) credit hours in a "cohort" 
based model.  “Cohort” means that students will join the program along with another group of students 
and continue with this same group, or cohort, for the entire program.  If students’ schedules change and 
they must skip a semester, or wish to take classes at a pace slower than the suggested two-year 
program, they may interact with other cohorts in the program.   
All the online classes are 7or 8 weeks long.   Students who join a cohort in the fall complete two 8-week 
courses (August - December, 16 weeks), two 8-week courses in spring (January - May, 16 weeks), and 
two 7-week courses in the summer (May - August, 14 weeks).   
Please view the institution’s Campus Calendar for more information.

Women’s Leadership 
MIN 5110 Equipping other for ministry: 
Equipping others for ministry is a part of our calling from God (Eph. 4:11-13). But how do we work with 
others so that we reach maturity together? This course will help you see that ministry is not just about 
doing the ministry yourself, but teaching others to join you in various arenas of ministry. You will learn 
about God’s equipping ministry in your own life, and be challenged to imitate His methods of entrusting 
others with redemptive work through His Spirit. The class will explore various methods of equipping 
others, including mentoring, coaching and modeling, and will address the challenges of recruiting, 
training and retaining volunteers or key staff members. Three hours. 
 
MIN 5360 Women in Scripture 
Students will explore the value of women as disclosed in special revelation, beginning with Genesis and 
the “imago dei”. They will research the backdrop of the ancient world in order to understand the various 
roles women played in the OT in revealing the heart of God and His plan for redemptive history. They 
will investigate ways that Jesus elevated the status of women and how NT passages describe the 
function of women within the Christian community. Using modern theories on the role of women—
complementarian and egalitarian—students will seek to define a biblical approach to contemporary 
questions about the role of women. In addition, students will analyze current culture and make 
recommendations for how God’s Word speaks into the lives of women today. Three hours. 
 
MIN 5820 Soul Care in Leadership: 
This class will examine how to journey with others in the midst of their questions and pain. Instead of 
trying to fix others in pain, soul care attempts to incarnate the presence of God in the life of another and 
allow God to use you to be his hands and feet. Part of this process is learning how to listen to the Spirit 
of God and attend to another in the midst of their journey. The learner will have the opportunity to see 
and reject patterns of self-talk (based on the flesh) in order to embrace Spirit-led patters of soul talk. 
The care of souls is an interpersonal part of ministry leadership that often gets overlooked in our 
program-driven church context. This class will help to equip ministry leaders in their role as shepherd to 
the flock entrusted to their care.     
 
MIN 5600 Biblical Foundations of Leadership: 
This course looks at the life of Jesus to learn from Him as the Master Teacher, Leader and Discipler. 
Students will explore Scripture and the lives of other godly men and women to gain a composite picture 
of leadership that addresses heart issues in the lives of people they will lead. Leadership from a biblical 
perspective will be countercultural and address issues of pride vs. humility, how we view failure/success 
and taking initiative in a Spirit-driven process. Students will have the opportunity for hands on 
integration of theory with practice as they process the course concepts in life with others in a relational 
context of ministry. 
 
Counseling  
 
MIN 5500 Counseling Theories 
In this course, students will examine today’s predominant counseling theories in order to develop their 
own biblical framework in which they will provide counsel to others. The focus of the course is to help 
discern God’s pathway to proper biblical counseling. Three hours. 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025

33 
May 2023 
MIN 5700 Counseling Methods and Techniques 
This course will examine the various skills, methods and techniques used by a Christian or Pastoral 
Counselor to effectively minister to those being counseled. An aspect of the course is how to use the 
Bible and prayer in counseling, and direction on when to refer to other professionals. Three hours. 
MIN 5900 Pre-Marital and Marital Counseling 
This course will examine how to effectively engage in pre-marital counseling to help couples prepare for 
marriage and to help couples who are struggling in their marriage. Various theories, skills and 
techniques of marriage counseling will be discussed. Three hours. 
MIN 6200 Counseling Common Problems 
This course will examine how to counsel people who encounter negative emotions such as anxiety, 
depression, guilt and fear and help navigate these issues from a biblical perspective. The focus will be on 
how God can help people deal with the emotional side of their lives by looking at Scripture and allowing 
God to move them into places of spiritual transformation. Three hours. 
PM 6160 Biblical Psychology 
This course will examine the relationship between the fields of psychology and theology. A theology of 
“integration” will be presented, along with discussions concerning specific “psychological” topics (i.e. 
personality, sensation/perception, self-esteem, etc.) from a biblical vantage point. A biblical discussion 
of depression and anxiety will be an aspect of this course, along with how one would use this material to 
counsel/minister to others.  Three hours.  
PM 6060 Legal and Ethical Issues in Pastoral Counseling 
This course is designed to develop a broad biblical knowledge base, critical thinking and ethical decision-
making skills for pastoral counselors. A focus will be given to a high standard of personal and 
professional ethics to enhance pastoral counseling that is above reproach. Three hours. Three hours. 
Technology 
 
PM 5180 Technology & Media in Ministry 
This course addresses the everchanging media technology challenges that ministries face 
today. This course identifies the ever changing and complex landscape of media technology in a media-
centric society and how ministries can use modern media effectively to communicate the life-changing 
message of Jesus Christ. Three hours. 
 
PM 5190 Worship Arts 
This course is designed to address corporate worship within the context of media   technology. This 
course acknowledges the need for technology to accomplish tasks as well as produce creative media rich 
environments for worship experiences. Three hours. 
 
PM 6070 Creative Communication Strategies 
A comprehensive approach to building mission-driven and culturally-sensitive ministry 
communications.  Involves integration of traditional, social, and digital media for providing 
relevant information, inspiration, instruction, marketing, and promotion to ministry stakeholders. Three

hours.

Intercultural Studies Concentration in the M.A. in Christian Ministry   
48 credit hours 
 
Purpose of the Program 
A major part of ministry in God’s work today is in an intercultural setting, either in international missions 
where it is cross-cultural, or in a person’s home country where it is multicultural. To prepare people for 
this kind of ministry, Grace Theological Seminary offers a Master of Arts in Intercultural Studies that is 
intended to equip students for cross-cultural or multicultural ministry. It is not designed to prepare 
individuals for the senior pastorate. 
 
Program Description 
The Master of Arts in Intercultural Studies is a 48-hour degree program. The curriculum is designed to 
prepare students for effective cross-cultural ministry. 
Courses are offered each summer in May and July to accommodate students in full-time ministry. 
Advance standing credit may be obtained for up to twelve credit hours of the 48-hour master’s program. 
Academic Requirements 
A cumulative grade point average of 2.5 (on a 4.0 scale) or above for the entire course of study is 
required for graduation. No more than 24 credit hours of graduate study may be transferred from 
approved schools. At least 18 credit hours must be taken in residency at Grace Theological Seminary’s 
Winona Lake campus. Up to 12 hours of advanced standing may be applied to this program. Advanced 
standing credit hours, when combined with transfer credits may not exceed 24 credit hours. Students 
having had previous theological training may waive theological studies courses and replace them with 
the electives indicated or additional hours in Area Studies or Missiological Research.

Women’s Leadership Concentration in M.A. in  Christian Ministry 
48 credit hours 
 
Grace College and Seminary and Women of Grace U.S.A. are partnering to provide this degree 
opportunity for women who are already in ministry and are looking for quality training to develop their 
leadership skills.  The Women’s Leadership Studies program is for women who desire interaction and 
challenge from others within ministry.  This new program will help women to grow in their personal 
awareness of strengths and weaknesses as a leader in a Christian ministry setting.  This program will also 
help these women develop both ministry values and skills to make genuine connections with others in 
order to experience God’s love through spiritual friendships and community.  Women in this program 
will gain leadership skills related to the organization and administration of ministry programs in church, 
para-church and mission environments while internalizing a biblical worldview of dependency on God.

MASTER OF ARTS IN LOCAL CHURCH MINISTRY (DEPLOY) 
Purpose of the Program 
Deploy’s Master of Arts in Local Church Ministry degree is a graduate-level master’s degree delivered 
within students’ ministry context. Deploy is a competency-based education program, and as such, 
includes both academic and applied learning.  
 
Competency-based theological education has been described by the Association of Theological Schools 
as being “both an educational philosophy and an academic model that ‘begins with the end in mind.’” 
Deploy, as a competency-based theological education program, was designed to help students become 
proficient in the competencies that are most important for students to master in order to be successful 
and have integrity in ministry.  
 
With traditional education, students take courses in a fixed amount of time and learn as much as they 
are able to in the midst of that time. The fixed variable is time, and the dependent variable is learning. 
Students walk away from a semester-long course having earned an A, B, C, or D level, and then they 
move on. In CBTE, the fixed variable is learning while the dependent variable is time. Deploy MALCM 
students must demonstrate mastery of each competency in their program at either an A or B level. They 
are able to accelerate through competencies in which they are already proficient, and they are able to 
spend more time in a given competency until they are able to exhibit mastery.  
 
Program Description 
This degree in Local Church Ministry requires 42 semester hours of graduate work. This competency-
based theological education program is distinct from traditional master’s degrees, as shown below:  
 
Highly Flexible 
Deploy is substantially more flexible in its pace and its location than other graduate programs. 
Students can easily make room for their education, as this program allows students to adjust 
their pace in response to the ebbs and flows of life and ministry.  
 
Application-Oriented 
Deploy measures students’ competency based on their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and 
application of what they have learned. All students will participate in active ministry in the local 
church throughout their program, allowing them to sharpen skills and put their knowledge to 
use in real-time. Nothing could be more real or valuable.   
 
Mentor-Supervised 
Deploy students consistently have three mentors during their program (a formation, ministry, 
and academic mentor). Academic mentors are credentialed faculty members who regularly 
dialogue with students concerning the content and progress on related competencies. Ministry 
and formation mentors provide regular feedback related to development of ministry skill and 
the personal, spiritual development of each student.  
 
In Context 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
42 
May 2023 
Deploy students study ministry as they are engaged in ministry. Many residential seminaries 
have apprenticeships which provide real-life experience for a portion of students’ programs. 
Deploy students are in the context of ministry throughout their program, constantly growing in  
both their intellectual and practical understanding and preparing holistically for ministry.  
 
Fits Your Life 
Students don’t need to relocate or leave their ministry context in order to be equipped for 
ministry. Deploy students complete their work from anywhere they are located. Deploy works 
with students to allow them to be fully present at home, in ministry, and beyond.  
 
Utilizes Prior Learning and Experiences 
Professional and ministry experience may allow some students to accelerate by demonstrating 
mastery in particular competencies quickly. Students don’t need to wait for the rest of their 
cohort—they simply prove competency and move on.  
 
In addition, students can apply for Transfer Credit or seek Advanced Standing with previous 
academic experience. (See Advanced Standing and Transfer Credit Policy for more information.) 
 
Entrance Requirements 
Students enrolled in the Deploy Master of Arts in Local Church Ministry program must be involved in a 
local congregation, as partnership with a local church is a requirement for many Mastery Assessments 
throughout students’ programs. Candidates with a bachelor’s degree (or an equivalent degree in the 
case of international students) from an approved institution are preferred. However, Grace Theological 
Seminary has made a pathway for students to earn the MALCM degree without a bachelor’s degree. For 
full details on non-bachelor’s consideration for the Deploy MALCM degree, contact the Seminary 
Admissions Office. 
Academic Requirements 
Deploy students must receive an 83% or above on each Mastery Assessment in order to pass their 
modules. Students are able to utilize three attempts on each Mastery Assessment to achieve this grade. 
Failure to do so could lead to academic probation or dismissal from Deploy. Competency grades are 
based on the cumulative average of all module grades for that particular competency. Students must 
achieve an 83% or above on each competency in order to pass.

MASTER OF DIVINITY (Residential and Online) 
Purpose of the Program 
The Master of Divinity program provides a basic three-year curriculum in graduate theological study for 
those preparing for a preaching and teaching ministry of the Word of God. This program is designed to 
furnish a broad foundation for people entering the pastorate, church-related counseling ministries, 
intercultural ministry, Christian education, and related types of Christian service. Students may choose 
from eight concentrations: General Studies, Pastoral, Pastoral Counseling, Christian Ministries, 
Intercultural Studies, Exegetical Studies, Women’s Leadership, and Chaplaincy Studies. 
Program Prerequisite 
The candidate must possess a bachelor’s degree, or an equivalent in the case of international students, 
from an approved institution, or be approved through the non-bachelor’s process (contact Seminary 
Admissions to learn more). Students who enter the Master of Divinity program without six earned 
credits, from an approved institution, are required to take six credits of Greek grammar at Grace 
Theological Seminary. These six credits are taken as undergraduate credit and do not count toward the 
student’s degree program, but are considered prerequisite coursework. In Deploy, Greek grammar is 
embedded in the M.Div. program. 
Residence Requirements 
The candidate must complete the three-year curriculum prescribed by the seminary, comprising a 
minimum of 75 semester hours of credit, with a grade point average of not less than 2.5 (on a 4.0 scale) 
for the entire period. Students transferring from other schools may be granted a maximum of 36 
semester hours of credit, providing that the work conforms to the academic standards and curricular 
requirements of this seminary. 
Up to 18 hours of advanced standing may be applied to this program. Credits earned through advanced 
standing reduce the number of hours that can be transferred. 
Language Requirements 
Students may earn advanced standing credit toward New Testament Greek I, II, and III as well as Biblical 
Hebrew I, II, and III. Competency tests are required to assess the student’s proficiency in the languages. 
Students with previous experience in Greek and/or Hebrew who feel the need to review are encouraged 
to audit New Testament Greek I and Biblical Hebrew I and then take for credit the subsequent New 
Testament Greek and Biblical Hebrew courses.

The M.Div. in Counseling is designed for those who desire to be involved primarily in a counseling 
ministry, but who also want a solid biblical and theological foundation upon which to build their 
perspectives and practices of counseling. This degree program is intended especially for those who 
desire to minister through counseling under the auspices of the local church. The program is not 
structured to prepare an individual to fill the position of the senior pastor who carries the primary 
preaching and administrative responsibilities of a local church, nor is it designed to equip the student for 
licensure as a professional counselor. 
Counseling Practicum 
M.Div. students with a pastoral counseling concentration are given the flexibility to design their 
apprenticeship in a way that fits their future goals best. Either in a local church setting, pastoral 
counseling or a little of both.

The Christian Ministry concentration equips leaders preparing to serve in settings that advance the 
gospel and facilitate growth in Christ, such as churches, Christian non-profits, and para-church 
organizations. The program challenges learners to think developmentally about how people mature 
spiritually, how to create effective outreach and discipleship programs, and how to teach for life 
transformation. The curriculum covers a wide range of integrated content as an acknowledgement that 
ministry is complex, because people are complex. The Christian Ministry program provides strategic 
theoretical principles integrated with life application so leaders can invest their talents in God's 
redemptive work in the world.

MASTER OF DIVINITY (DEPLOY) 
Purpose of the Program 
Deploy’s Master Divinity in General Ministry degree is a graduate-level master’s degree delivered within 
students’ ministry context. Deploy is a competency-based education program, and as such, includes 
both academic and applied learning.  
 
Competency-based theological education has been described by the Association of Theological Schools 
as being “both an educational philosophy and an academic model that ‘begins with the end in mind.’” 
Deploy, as a competency-based theological education program, was designed to help students become 
proficient in the competencies that are most important for students to master in order to be successful 
and have integrity in ministry.  
 
With traditional education, students take courses in a fixed amount of time and learn as much as they 
are able to in the midst of that time. The fixed variable is time, and the dependent variable is learning. 
Students walk away from a semester-long course having earned an A, B, C, or D level, and then they 
move on. In CBTE, the fixed variable is learning while the dependent variable is time. Deploy MDiv 
students must demonstrate mastery of each competency in their program at either an A or B level. They 
are able to accelerate through competencies in which they are already proficient, and they are able to 
spend more time in a given competency until they are able to exhibit mastery.  
 
Program Description 
This degree requires 75 semester hours of graduate work. This competency-based theological education 
program is distinct from traditional master’s degrees, as shown below:  
 
Highly Flexible 
Deploy is substantially more flexible in its pace and its location than other graduate programs. 
Students can easily make room for their education, as this program allows students to adjust 
their pace in response to the ebbs and flows of life and ministry.  
 
Application-Oriented 
Deploy measures students’ competency based on their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and 
application of what they have learned. All students will participate in active ministry in the local 
church throughout their program, allowing them to sharpen skills and put their knowledge to 
use in real-time. Nothing could be more real or valuable.   
 
Mentor-Supervised 
Deploy students consistently have three mentors during their program (a formation, ministry, 
and academic mentor). Academic mentors are credentialed faculty members who regularly 
dialogue with students concerning the content and progress on related competencies. Ministry 
and formation mentors provide regular feedback related to development of ministry skill and 
the personal, spiritual development of each student.  
 
In Context 
Deploy students study ministry as they are engaged in ministry. Many residential seminaries 
have apprenticeships which provide real-life experience for a portion of students’ programs. 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
54 
May 2023 
Deploy students are in the context of ministry throughout their program, constantly growing in  
both their intellectual and practical understanding and preparing holistically for ministry.  
 
Fits Your Life 
Students don’t need to relocate or leave their ministry context in order to be equipped for 
ministry. Deploy students complete their work from anywhere they are located. Deploy works 
with students to allow them to be fully present at home, in ministry, and beyond.  
 
Utilizes Prior Learning and Experiences 
Professional and ministry experience may allow some students to accelerate by demonstrating 
mastery in particular competencies quickly. Students don’t need to wait for the rest of their 
cohort—they simply prove competency and move on.  
 
In addition, students can apply for Transfer Credit or seek Advanced Standing with previous 
academic experience. (See Advanced Standing and Transfer Credit Policy for more information.) 
 
Entrance Requirements 
Students enrolled in the Deploy Master of Divinity program must be involved in a local congregation, as 
partnership with a local church is a requirement for many Mastery Assessments throughout students’ 
programs. Candidates with a bachelor’s degree (or an equivalent degree in the case of international 
students) from an approved institution are preferred. However, Grace Theological Seminary has made a 
pathway for students to earn the MDiv degree without a bachelor’s degree. For full details on entrance 
requirements for the Deploy MDiv degree, contact the Seminary Admissions Office. 
Academic Requirements 
Deploy students must receive an 83% or above on each Mastery Assessment in order to pass their 
modules. Students are able to utilize three attempts on each Mastery Assessment to achieve this grade. 
Failure to do so could lead to academic probation or dismissal from Deploy. Competency grades are 
based on the cumulative average of all module grades for that particular competency. Students must 
achieve an 83% or above on each competency in order to pass.

required D.Min. Professional Project.  
 
Academic Requirements  
All general academic requirements outlined elsewhere in this catalog apply to the Doctor of Ministry 
program. The D.Min. Committee may place any student who receives a grade of less than a “B-” in any 
seminar on academic probation. A student’s program may be terminated by the D.Min. Committee if a 
grade of less than a “B-” is earned in two or more seminars. As an advanced ministry degree, the highest 
levels of academic, spiritual, and ministry expectations will be required. Students failing to meet these 
objectives of the program may be discontinued in the program.  
Transfer Credit from Other Institutions 
Grace Seminary DMin students may receive credit for a total of up to two doctoral courses (6 credit 
hours total) from another ATS-accredited seminary. Any such credit would be extended only after 
evaluating and comparing those transcripted courses for correspondence to our curriculum and 
program objectives.  Transferrable seminars may be (1) taken prior to arriving at Grace, (2) taken 
concurrently while at Grace, or (3) a combination of both.  Current Grace DMin students seeking to take 
courses at other institutions as a visiting scholar should seek transfer approval prior to taking such 
courses in order to guarantee academic credit. 
 
 
Program Continuation 
The D.Min. Continuation Policy ensures godly stewardship of Grace Seminary resources and encourages 
students to make timely progress toward their goal of graduation. Each semester throughout their 
program doctoral students are expected to maintain ongoing enrollment.  In the event a student does 
not register for a doctoral seminar/professional project any given semester, he or she will automatically 
be placed into “Continuing Registration” status. 
 
Since only a limited number of students can be effectively serviced, Continuing Registration status 
preserves a student's spot in the program, despite their temporary lapse in enrollment, while allowing 
them to maintain student status, along with access to faculty, student email accounts, and other campus 
resources and materials.  Continuing Registration status is allowable for no more than one year in order 
to ensure high graduation rates and to faculty's full investment in the lives of active students.  
 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025 
Grace Theological Seminary  
59 
May 2023 
Following a year (Summer and Fall) of Continuing Registration, students must either withdraw from the 
program or communicate in writing to the Director of Doctoral Programs regarding their desire to 
continue in study, along with a personal degree completion plan and proposed graduation date.  If 
permitted to continue in the program, the student agrees to register for at least one seminar per year 
for the duration of their program.  Failing to do so will result in the requirement to submit a Program 
Withdrawal Form or face institutional expulsion. 
 
Continuing Registration status incurs a fee of $100 each semester.  The Continuing Registration fee may 
be waived based upon the following circumstances: 
1. The student suffers an incapacitating illness or injury. 
2. The student experiences a change in ministry requiring a time of adjustment. 
3. The student serves as a missionary outside the U.S. precluding attendance on campus except during 
furlough periods. 
4. The student has already taken all of the courses offered in a given semester. 
5. Other exceptional circumstances warranting Continuing Registration as determined by the Doctoral 
Committee. 
  
Program Completion 
The Doctor of Ministry has been structured in such a way that the degree may be completed in as little 
as three years of concentrated study.  The Doctoral Committee believes that as little as three and as 
much as five years is sufficient time to complete the program, so doctoral candidates remain current 
with course content and latest research. 
 
If not completed in a period of five academic years, a student will be required to submit a Program 
Withdrawal Form or a One-Year Program Extension Form. If an extension is approved, a $250 charge per 
semester will be assessed on the student's bill as a means of accountability and the servicing of student 
records and advising.  If not completed after the initial one-year extension, the student shall withdraw 
from the program.  On rare occasions a second and final year-long extension may be requested 
assuming (a) sufficient evidence for the delay is presented and (b) a substantial plan for timely 
completion is proposed.  During that final one-year extension, the student would continue to be 
assessed the $250 extension fee, in addition to attending regular and required (in person or online) 
meetings with the Director of Doctoral Programs or First Reader.  No student will be allowed to continue 
enrollment in the Doctor of Ministry program following the end of the statute of limitations.  Students 
who do not apply for an extension after three years will be asked to submit a Program Withdrawal Form.  
Students who still have not completed the program after a one-year extension will be asked to submit a 
Program Withdrawal Form. Students who wish to be readmitted into the program must submit a 
petition in writing to the Director of Doctoral Programs explaining clearly and concretely how they plan 
to complete the program in a timely manner. If the Doctoral Committee approves the petition, the 
student must file a Readmit Form with the Seminary Admissions Office. If readmitted, the student may 
be asked to register for up to two seminars per academic year or the Professional Project. 
 
Independent Study 
D.Min. students are allowed to take one independent study course (3 hrs.) with a Grace Seminary 
professor.  The tuition amount for an independent study course is identical to that charged for a 
traditional D.Min. course. 
Continuing Education  
Pastors, missionaries, and other vocational Christian workers desiring to audit a seminar are invited to 
register as unclassified students and pay the audit fee. Graduates of Grace’s D.Min. program may attend

classes on an informal basis for $100. A schedule for upcoming seminars may be obtained on the Grace 
Web site  https://seminary.grace.edu/programs/doctor-ministry-pastoral-studies/  or from the Director 
of Doctoral Programs. 
   
Provisional Admission Students 
A student who qualifies for the Doctor of Ministry program may complete up to two D.Min. seminars (6 
hours) as a “provisional admission” student before he or she has been fully accepted into the program.  
Full-time Students  
Full-time doctoral students are those enrolled in a doctoral level program for at least six semester hours 
of credit during a regular semester. The exceptions to this F1 visa students must fulfill full-time 
registration every semester to maintain their visa status. For F1 students that does not apply to 
summers, only spring and fall semesters. 
 
Tuition and Fees  
Current Doctor of Ministry tuition rates may be obtained from the Grace Schools Business Office or from 
the Grace Seminary Web site https://seminary.grace.edu/. D.Min. seminary fees must be paid in full 
during the week of class.  
A non-refundable $250 deposit paid 90 days before the beginning of each seminar (to register and 
receive pre- course assignments) will be applied toward the tuition. As indicated above, D.Min. students 
are required to pay the remaining seminar tuition in full during the week of class.  
The fee for the Professional Project (seminar) must be paid by the student at the outset of the semester

TH 505 and TH 506 or their equivalents. Three hours. 
Old Testament Studies 
Since the Old Testament, like the New, is divinely inspired, it must be given serious attention as an 
indispensable source for doctrine, correction, and spiritual growth. Its narratives provide hundreds of 
examples of God’s dealings with humankind, and by this we gain important insights into the heart of 
God and His expectations for His people. Its poetry exhibits the joys and agonies of those who pursued 
godliness, and its prophecies reveal God’s concern for Israel in ancient times as well as the future. The 
Old Testament is critical to the work of the pastor or Christian leader in preaching, teaching, discipling, 
counseling, and dealing with the challenges of administration. 
The seminary, therefore, requires all M.Div. candidates to acquire the ability to translate the Hebrew 
text of the Old Testament, to gain some practical work in the field of scientific exegesis, and to study the 
methods and results of biblical archaeology, literary criticism, and ancient near eastern backgrounds. 
The ultimate goal of these disciplines is not for mere intellectual entertainment, but to enable the 
student to present the theological, historical, and practical truths of the Old Testament through 
expository preaching and teaching.

In all areas, the Word of God must be applied to the lives of those to whom God has graciously given it. 
It must be delivered to the lost through the work of evangelism; it must be given to God’s redeemed 
people through educational programs designed for nurture and equipping; it must be applied to special 
personal needs in the pastor’s office. 
This department, therefore, is a part of the “how to” segment of the seminary program, instructing the 
student in appropriate perspectives and attitudes for ministry. This department also seeks to provide

PM 6600 Principles & Practice of Prayer 
This course will take an in-depth look at prayer as God’s means of leading and strengthening faithful 
servants for His work among Christians and non-Christians of this age. Christian ministry depends on an 
intimate walk with God for stability and ongoing effectiveness of the ministerial servant, for spiritual 
formation in the lives of those to whom we minister, and for the strategic planning necessary for 
effective missional ministry. Not only will the theology and instructions about prayer be examined, but it

MI 5250   Understanding and Engaging Culture  
This course examines culture.  It explores the roots of culture as a foundational and overarching 
expression of humanities vocations as “imaging” of God in Scripture. The subsequent harmonies and 
dissonances between historical expressions of culture and Christianity are analyzed and discussed.  Also, 
contemporary expressions of popular digital culture, film, video and music, will be selectively surveyed 
with an eye to developing the capacity to constructively and critically engage culture as 
Christians.  Three hours 
 
PM 5340 Women in Scripture 
Students will explore the various roles women played in the OT against the backdrop of the ancient 
world. They will investigate ways that Jesus elevated the status of women and how NT passages 
describe the function of women within the Christian community. Using modern theories on the role of 
women—hierarchical, complementarian, and egalitarian—students will seek to define a biblical 
approach to contemporary questions about the role of women. MIN 5360. Three hours. 
PM 5550 Biblical Foundations of Leadership 
This course looks at the life of Jesus to learn from Him as the Master Teacher, Leader and Discipler.  
Students will explore Scripture and the lives of other godly men and women to gain a composite picture 
of leadership that addresses heart issues in the lives of people they will lead.  Leadership from a biblical 
perspective will be countercultural and address issues of pride vs. humility, how we view failure/success 
and taking initiative in a Spirit-driven process.  Students will have the opportunity for hands on 
integration of theory with practice as they process the course concepts in life with others in a relational 
context of ministry. MIN 5600. Three hours. 
 
PM 5730 Soul Care in Leadership 
This class will examine how to journey with others in the midst of their questions and pain. Instead of 
trying to fix others in pain, soul care attempts to incarnate the presence of God in the life of another and 
allow God to use you to be his hands and feet. Part of this process is learning how to listen to the Spirit 
of God and attend to another in the midst of their journey. The learner will have the opportunity to see 
and reject patterns of self-talk (based on the flesh) in order to embrace Spirit-led patters of soul talk. 
The care of souls is an interpersonal part of ministry leadership that often gets overlooked in our 
program-driven church context. This class will help to equip ministry leaders in their role as shepherd to 
the flock entrusted to their care. MIN 5820. Three hours.

context rather than to spread a veneer of Christian values over that culture. The contextualization of 
methodology, theology, and forms and expressions in the local church is discussed. The danger of 
Western values being expressed in Bible interpretation and the importance of taking into consideration 
the religious worldview and the definitions used in the receiving culture are discussed. Emphasis is

true Gospel in each religious context. Attention will be given to Animism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, 
and their variant forms, as well as many smaller religious systems. One to three hours. 
MI 7290 Intercultural Apprenticeship  
The Intercultural Apprenticeship is a guided experience and study program in a cross-cultural setting. It 
involves a culture discovery program for gaining insights into the target culture and understanding the 
people in their actual situation. It provides exposure to the culture in various areas and experience in 
various levels of evangelism, discipleship, and church development within this new environment giving

Deploy Course Descriptions 
Note: DGM (MDiv) and DLC (MALCM) – Credits are credit equivalencies 
 
DGM 5050 | DLC 5050 Orientation and Student Success 
Students will be competent to enter the Deploy program, demonstrating understanding of its 
distinctives, tuition and billing, financial aid, student support services, academic policies, and enrollment 
and withdrawal information. Students will be competent to use key website throughout their Deploy 
program, including the Learning Management System (Canvas), the Portal, and Nelnet. Students will also 
demonstrate an ability to succeed in Deploy by doing reliable research and writing at a graduate level. 
Students will demonstrate this by knowledge and practice of: 1) proper format (Turabian), 2) guidelines 
to proper citation methods (preventing plagiarism), 3) grammatical structure and syntax, 4) 
compositional skills (thesis statement, topic sentence, providing evidence for claims, persuasion, clear 
structure, introduction and conclusion), 5) acquiring information from appropriate academic resources 
(e.g. scholarship: peer reviewed, edited/published materials). Zero hour prerequisite course.   
DGM 5100-5103 | DLC 5100-5103 Embracing Sanctification 
Students will be competent to understand and cooperate with God in the sanctification process. In order 
to be competent in this process, the student will grow in acquiring double knowledge: knowledge of God 
and knowledge of self. This knowledge deals with the root of heart issues out of which flow either the 
fruit of righteousness (leading to life) or the fruit of unrighteousness (leading to death). The biblical 
mandate to put off the old man and put on the new man is fundamentally a matter of the heart, not of 
behavioral modification. Therefore, signs of growth include 1) rejecting lies, which includes brokenness 
and repentance over sin, while, 2) embracing the truth of one’s life in Christ, lived out through pursuing 
transformation of the mind through the hungry intake of the Truth. The mind set on the Spirit will 
produce the fruit of the Spirit. The student will also need to understand the common stages related to 
spiritual formation and be able to identify key markers in each phase of the journey, including God’s use 
of consolation and desolation to promote growth. The spiritual disciplines become tools to open oneself 
to God; and in the process, what’s in one’s heart will be revealed. Competence in double knowledge 
recognizes that spiritual disciplines enable a person to humbly position themselves to hear God speak 
and to invite Him to do His transforming work. Practicing the spiritual disciplines requires significant 
effort, but as Dallas Willard says, God is opposed to earning, not effort. What happens in the disciplines 
such as solitude, reading God’s word, praying (including intercession, petitions, listening, and worship), 
or fasting only have value in as much as they foster an intimate and dependent relationship with God. 
Three hours.

DGM 5300-5303 | DLC 5300-5303 Becoming a Mature Disciple 
Students will be competent in the process of becoming a mature disciple who is loving God and loving 
others. Students will learn to relate to God in a healthy manner. This involves a fully devoted heart that 
embraces Christ as King, where the pilgrim gives Him full authority and allows Him to prioritize his/her 
value system. In order to relate to God in this way, the mature disciple will grow in understanding the 
role of the human heart, the complexity of this biblical concept, and the realities of how the heart is 
shaped. The problem with a sinful heart is that it desires self and sin rather than God and His way. Even 
as a Christian, one needs to be aware of the sinful tendencies that are still at work in the redeemed 
heart, so that the life of Christ may be fully appropriated. Three hours.  
*DGM 5400-5202 | DLC 5400-5202 Research and Writing was previously offered but has been removed 
from the program. It’s learning outcomes have been reallocated into modules within DGM/DLC 5800 
and 5900. MA students will take DLC 5804 in lieu of DLC 5400-5402, or be permitted to seek course 
substitution to fulfill their degree requirements. MDiv students are not permitted to seek course 
substitution to fulfill their degree requirements in light of the MDiv program’s overall reduction from 90 
to 75cr.

DGM 5700-5703 | DLC 5700-5703 Exercising Flexibility in Ministry 
Learners will be proficient to exercise appropriate flexibility. The student will become aware of personal 
preferences and learn to deal with them in a way which avoids the tendency toward legalism, and 
instead, demonstrates grace-filled respect; discerns the difference between flexibility and people 
pleasing; and distinguish the difference between conviction driven leadership and high control-low 
trust-driven leadership. In addition, in the spirit of the Apostle Paul’s words, “I have become all things to 
all men that I might save some,” the student will develop a growing level of cultural flexibility which 
flows from a knowledge of and respect for diverse cultures through an exposure to different people 
groups. Three hours. 
DGM 5800-5812 | DLC 5800-5804 Applying Biblical Exegesis 
Students will be competent in Biblical Exegesis. The student will be competent to use an exegetical

Students will be competent to articulate and apply Biblical Theology. The student will be competent to 
describe and articulate the history, methodology, and content of Biblical Theology. Special attention is 
given to the progressive revelation and development of Scripture’s main storyline, key themes, 
continuity and discontinuity between the Old and New Testaments, and a gospel-centered, Christ-
focused, canonically-sensitive approach to reading and interpreting the Bible as they relate to one’s 
personal life, the lives of Christians, and local ministry context. MDiv: Six hours. MA: Five hours. 
DGM 6000-6015 Utilizing Biblical Languages 
Students will be competent to apply the basics of phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary of 
biblical Greek and Hebrew to their study of Scripture. This competency will cover the essentials of 
Biblical Greek and Hebrew with an emphasis on phonology, morphology, syntax, and vocabulary. The 
purpose is to understand Biblical Greek and Hebrew for the purpose of translating and doing exegesis in 
the Hebrew Old Testament and Greek New Testament. MDiv Only: Fifteen hours. 
 
DGM 6100-6106 Applying Foundational Doctrines

the different areas of Systematic Theology including: Bibliology, Theology Proper, Christology, 
Pneumatology, Angelology, Anthropology, Hamartiology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, and Eschatology as 
they relate to one’s personal life, the lives of Christians, and the local ministry context. MDiv Only: Six 
hours.  
DGM 6200-6203 Understanding the Development of Doctrine 
Students will be competent to understand and articulate an overview of the development of doctrine in 
the church. The student will be competent to understand the development of doctrine in the church 
from the Apostolic Fathers through the 21st century.  This includes church confessions, major 
theological movements and controversies, and important theologians.  The student will demonstrate 
the ability to apply insights gleaned from historical theology to one’s own Christian life, local ministry 
context, and current challenges for theology and the Church. MDiv Only: Three hours.  
DGM 6300-6303 | DLC 6000-6003 Embodying the Love of God 
Students will be competent to show love and compassion to others. Those who are learning 
competence to show love and compassion have experienced the initiating love of God at an in-depth 
level for themselves. Relating to others in love requires discerning and demonstrating appropriate ways 
to nurture growth in the life of another. They are committed to becoming an exceptional listener by 
soliciting feedback from others as they develop empathy. They exercise the freedom to both nurture 
and confront, to rescue and release, and to discern when to reach out and when to wait. They are not 
motivated by a Messiah complex [unrealistic valuation of their own importance and ability to save 
people, but are compelled by love (2 Cor. 5:4)]. They are developing boundary-setting habits in order to 
prioritize loving their family, while showing compassion to those within and outside the church. They 
learn from those who have established a track record of loving “hard to love people” within their sphere 
of influence. They follow the example of Christ whose rhythm of life included loving extravagantly and 
being replenished deeply through intimate times with His Heavenly Father and selected disciples. They 
seek out authentic friendship and spiritual community for mutual encouragement. Three hours.  
DGM 6400-6403 | DLC 6100-6103 Embracing Cultural Diversity 
Students will be competent to understand cultural diversity. The student will understand cultural

understanding of cultural diversity into appropriate and culturally relevant, biblical ministry within 
diverse contexts. Three hours.  
DGM 6500-6503 | DLC 6200-6203 Articulating Personal Theology 
Students will be competent to articulate their own theology in light of their denominational/church 
affiliation. Students will understand and be able to articulate and explain their own theological 
convictions as they relate to their denominational or church affiliation, and complete the necessary 
preparations for ordination, or as if they were pursuing ordination. Three hours.  
DGM 6600-6603 | DLC 6300-6303 Resolving Leadership Conflict 
Learners will become competent to grasp and adapt to leadership pressures, conflict, and criticisms that 
are inherent in transformational ministry. This competency requires a leader to understand personal 
leadership tendencies due to family background and other personal influences (people and 
experiences), taking steps toward building on the strengths and being released from unhealthy patterns. 
A leader is fundamentally a Christ follower, who is teachable and solicits wisdom from relevant 
resources. This type of leader is learning to avoid the tendency to discount one’s own voice, giftedness 
and Spirit-led convictions. Doing so, prevents pitfalls such as plagiarizing sermons, idolizing Christian

DI 8300 Ethics and Morality Across Cultures 
All Christians hold values derived from their culture. Many, if not most of these values, shape the 
expression of Christianity in their culture. Much of this is good as it reflects how Christianity is relevant 
in their context. In many cases, cultural norms define what obedience to God’s Word should look like in 
that particular context in regard to expressions of God’s will such as “honor your father and your 
mother,” and “husbands love your wives,” or yet “steal no longer….”  These culturally defined behaviors 
seek to respect God’s will and honor His name, but they depend on cultural definitions and therefore 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog | 2023-2025

May 2023 
change from culture to culture. Obedience to God’s will is, to some extent, relative to the context in

Community Lifestyle Pledge 
Students agree to show respect for the faith commitment that Grace practices and agree to abide by 
certain of the institution's community guidelines (avoidance of disrespecting others, sexual misconduct, 
illegal drugs, gambling, coarse or obscene language, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and such conduct) 
while on campus or engaged in Grace activities. The student understands that this extends to any 
advocacy initiatives in which the individual might participate while a Grace student. 
 
 Computer Usage/Web Site/Blogs/Social Media  
Grace College realizes the value added to technology and relationship building through use of the 
Internet. It is expected that members of the Grace College community maintain appropriate behavior 
while applying scriptural values to any personal Web content created. This includes, but is not limited to, 
blogs, personal and business social media accounts (including, but not limited to: Facebook, Instagram, 
Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok and Tumblr), websites, and/or other creative content. This includes 
“anonymous” content that can reasonably be traced back or attributed to a Grace student. Ultimately, 
Grace students are responsible for what they post or comment online. Therefore, students should not 
post content on social media that violates Grace community lifestyle policies. Posts or comments that 
are harassing or discriminatory to individuals or groups of people, or that reveal community standard 
violations, will result in consequences. Students must comply with copyright laws, file sharing laws, and 
avoid plagiarism. See our “Academic Integrity” policy for more details.  
 
Classification of Graduate Students 
Full-time Students: Full-time students are those enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate program for 
at least 6 semester hours of credit during a regular semester.    
 
Part-time Students: Part-time students are those enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate program 
for at least 3 hours of credit during a regular semester. 
Auditors: Students who desire to hear the lectures in a course without undertaking the coursework for 
credit may be admitted as auditors to selected courses by making proper application with the Online 
Admissions Office. Though no credits or grade points are involved, auditors are required to pay the 
appropriate fees and to meet class attendance requirements. Those who do not meet attendance 
requirements will receive the “grade” of “W,” whether or not they have officially withdrawn. 
 
Auditing is not permitted for some courses. (This policy is at the discretion of the department or 
professor involved.) For some courses, auditing is permitted only if the student completes the course 
assignments as specified by the professor. An auditor may enroll for only one semester as a “full-time” 
auditor.  
 
HLC Criteria as Applied to the School of Professional and Online Education  
 
Faculty teaching in the School of Professional and Online Education should have completed a program of 
study in the discipline or subfield in which they teach, and/or for which they develop curricula, with the 
coursework at least one level above that of the courses being taught or developed/or a current teaching 
or administrator license in the field. The School of Professional and Online Education can determine that 
a faculty member is qualified based on experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the 
degree it would otherwise require for a faculty position.

• 
Faculty teaching in the School of Professional and Online Education GRADUATE programs should 
hold a terminal degree in the program in which they are teaching. If a faculty member holds a 
master’s degree or higher in a discipline or subfield other than that in which he or she is 
teaching, that faculty member should have completed a minimum of 18 graduate hours in the 
discipline or subfield in which they teach.  See the SPOE Process for Exceptions. 
 
School of Professional and Online Education Process for Exceptions 
HLC Assumed Practice B.2 allows an institution to determine that a faculty member is qualified based on 
experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the degree it would otherwise require for a 
faculty position. This experience should be tested experience in that it includes a breadth and depth of 
experience outside of the classroom in real-world situations relevant to the discipline in which the faculty 
member would be teaching. An institution that intends to use tested experience as a basis for hiring 
faculty must have a well-defined policy and procedure for determining when such experience is sufficient 
to determine that the faculty member has the expertise necessary to teach students in that discipline. 
 
Deans and faculty leaders assess faculty members’ qualifications. Endorsements are considered when 
potential instructors do not have the academic credentials required by the Higher Learning Commission. 
These endorsements are dependent on the relevancy of the experience both to the degree level and to 
the specific content of the course for which the faculty member is responsible. These endorsements 
come in two forms: Endorsement by Equivalency and Endorsement by Exception. These endorsements 
are used when credentialing part-time instructors.  
 
ENDORSEMENT BY EQUIVALENCY is used when it is evident that an instructor has credentials that are 
“equivalent to” the degree required of our faculty in that content area.  This endorsement is in line with 
HLC guidelines that allow an individual’s knowledge and expertise to be determined by his or her tested 
experiences outside of the classroom in real-world situations relevant to the discipline in which the 
faculty member would be teaching. For example, an instructor can be credentialed to teach if that 
instructor has a minimum of ten years of industry-specific experience. Such life experience can qualify as 
an equivalent to academic credentials for the purpose of teaching, based on the judgment of 
knowledgeable faculty in the discipline. This endorsement is used when in faculty judgment it is not 
necessary for an instructor to pursue further studies to teach at the college in the approved area. 
 
ENDORSEMENT BY EXCEPTION is used when an instructor has demonstrated adequate knowledge and 
experience but has not met our standard for credentials. An example of such a situation would be the 
instructor who has a bachelor’s/master’s degree in a different teaching field, but has some 
certifications, professional affiliations, and a minimum of five years industry-specific or teaching 
experience.  
 
Note about the Catalog 
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs. 
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs.

 The provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded 
as a contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies 
governing admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. 
 
Grace reserves the right to change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without 
prior notice including academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, 
personnel, academic policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any 
courses described in the catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, 
make every attempt to give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog 
content when possible and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
 
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year. All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their 
selected program(s) of study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected 
program(s) may change from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be 
considered the catalog applicable to the student. 
 
 In some programs, students are asked to acknowledge in writing their receipt of the program’s catalog.  
Changes to an academic catalog that are necessary following the start of the fall semester will be noted 
as an addendum to the original catalog.  
 
Archived catalogs are maintained on the institution’s Web site. 
 
It is each student’s responsibility to schedule regular meetings with his or her academic advisor and to 
be knowledgeable about institutional requirements, academic regulations, and calendar deadlines 
specified in the catalogs and academic program publications. Students should read the catalog carefully 
and consult with an advisor to determine how these policies relate to their individual circumstances. 
 
Online Courses 
Some individual undergraduate courses at the institution are offered in an online format and most 
courses in the college and seminary use a learning management system to facilitate course delivery. 
Courses offered online are identified as such on the schedule published by the Registrar’s Office.

Note about the Catalog 
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs.  
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs. The 
provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded as a 
contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies governing 
admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. Grace reserves the right to 
change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without prior notice including 
academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, personnel, academic 
policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any courses described in the 
catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, make every attempt to 
give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog content when possible 
and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year.  
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student. 
 
Course Descriptions 
In the following courses, students will be explorers (not just observers) in the study of the Bible. The 
goal is to become skilled in interpretation and wise in application. Courses will focus on breadth and 
depth of learning, so that students are capable of dealing with both specific and global issues in the text.

ministers, Christian counselors, and other Christian ministry personnel will become more effective in 
various intercultural situations by shaping their ministry to penetrate other cultures more deeply. 
Knowing how culture functions, the extent to which it shapes people, and how we are affected by our 
own culture keeps us from reading our cultural values into other contexts and into our interpretation of 
the Bible. It also guards against unknowingly imposing our cultural values on others. The course will not

different from Armenian theology? How is progressive dispensationalism different from classic 
dispensationalism? Students will study the methods and presuppositions of leading theologians, from

Community Lifestyle Pledge  
Students agree to show respect for the faith commitment that Grace practices and agree to abide by 
certain of the institution's community guidelines (avoidance of disrespecting others, sexual misconduct, 
illegal drugs, gambling, coarse or obscene language, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and such conduct) 
while on campus or engaged in Grace activities. The student understands that this extends to any 
advocacy initiatives in which the individual might participate while a Grace student. 
 
Computer Usage/Web Site/Blogs/Social Media  
Grace College realizes the value added to technology and relationship building through use of 
the Internet. It is expected that members of the Grace College community maintain appropriate 
behavior while applying scriptural values to any personal Web content created. This includes, 
but is not limited to, blogs, personal and business social media accounts (including, but not 
limited to: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok and Tumblr), websites, and/or other 
creative content. This includes “anonymous” content that can reasonably be traced back or 
attributed to a Grace student. Ultimately, Grace students are responsible for what they post or 
comment online. Therefore, students should not post content on social media that violates 
Grace community lifestyle policies. Posts or comments that are harassing or discriminatory to 
individuals or groups of people, or that reveal community standard violations, will result in 
consequences. Students must comply with copyright laws, file sharing laws, and avoid 
plagiarism. See our “Academic Integrity” policy for more details.  
HLC Criteria as Applied to the School of Professional and Online Education  
Faculty teaching in the School of Professional and Online Education should have completed a program of 
study in the discipline or subfield in which they teach, and/or for which they develop curricula, with the 
coursework at least one level above that of the courses being taught or developed/or a current teaching 
or administrator license in the field. The School of Professional and Online Education can determine that 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog 2023-2025 
Degree Completion    3                                                                                           April 2023 
a faculty member is qualified based on experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the 
degree it would otherwise require for a faculty position. 
 
• 
Faculty teaching UNDERGRADUATE COURSES should hold a degree at least one level above that 
of the program in which they are teaching. Those faculty members teaching general education 
courses, or other non-occupational courses, hold a master’s degree or higher in the discipline or 
subfield. If a faculty member holds a master’s degree or higher in a discipline or subfield other 
than that in which he or she is teaching, that faculty member should have completed a 
minimum of 18 graduate hours in the discipline or subfield in which they teach. The School of 
Professional and Online Education has determined that an M.B.A. degree qualifies an instructor 
to teach all undergraduate business-related courses in the Weber, Degree Completion, as well 
as any other existing or new programs. An instructor with a master’s degree can teach GOL 3000 
Adult Learner or GOL 3010 Fundamentals of Lifelong Learning because these two courses are 
very introductory in nature and teach the fundamentals of learning and how to succeed in an 
undergraduate setting.  Furthermore, the School of Professional and Online Education can 
determine that a faculty member is qualified based on experience that the institution 
determines is equivalent to the degree it would otherwise require for a faculty position. See the 
SPOE Process for Exceptions. 
 
• 
Faculty teaching UNDERGRADUATE BIBLE/THEOLOGY-RELATED courses should hold a degree at 
least one level above that of the program in which they are teaching. Those faculty members 
teaching general education courses, or other non-occupational courses, hold a master’s degree 
or higher in the discipline or subfield. If a faculty member holds a master’s degree or higher in a 
discipline or subfield other than that in which he or she is teaching, that faculty member should 
have completed a minimum of 18 graduate hours in the discipline or subfield in which they 
teach. The School of Professional and Online Education has determined that an M.Div or other 
Bible-related degree qualifies an instructor to teach all undergraduate Bible-related courses in 
the Weber, Degree Completion, as well as other existing or new programs. Furthermore, the 
School of Professional and Online Education can determine that a faculty member is qualified 
based on experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the degree it would 
otherwise require for a faculty position. See the SPOE Process for Exceptions. 
 
School of Professional and Online Education Process for Exceptions 
HLC Assumed Practice B.2 allows an institution to determine that a faculty member is qualified based on 
experience that the institution determines is equivalent to the degree it would otherwise require for a 
faculty position. This experience should be tested experience in that it includes a breadth and depth of 
experience outside of the classroom in real-world situations relevant to the discipline in which the faculty 
member would be teaching. An institution that intends to use tested experience as a basis for hiring 
faculty must have a well-defined policy and procedure for determining when such experience is sufficient 
to determine that the faculty member has the expertise necessary to teach students in that discipline. 
 
Deans and faculty leaders assess faculty members’ qualifications. Endorsements are considered when 
potential instructors do not have the academic credentials required by the Higher Learning Commission. 
These endorsements are dependent on the relevancy of the experience both to the degree level and to 
the specific content of the course for which the faculty member is responsible. These endorsements 
Grace College and Seminary Catalog 2023-2025 
Degree Completion    4                                                                                           April 2023 
come in two forms: Endorsement by Equivalency and Endorsement by Exception. These endorsements 
are used when credentialing part-time instructors.  
 
ENDORSEMENT BY EQUIVALENCY is used when it is evident that an instructor has credentials that are 
“equivalent to” the degree required of our faculty in that content area.  This endorsement is in line with 
HLC guidelines that allow an individual’s knowledge and expertise to be determined by his or her tested 
experiences outside of the classroom in real-world situations relevant to the discipline in which the 
faculty member would be teaching. For example, an instructor can be credentialed to teach if that 
instructor has a minimum of ten years of industry-specific experience. Such life experience can qualify as 
an equivalent to academic credentials for the purpose of teaching, based on the judgment of 
knowledgeable faculty in the discipline. This endorsement is used when in faculty judgment it is not 
necessary for an instructor to pursue further studies to teach at the college in the approved area. 
 
ENDORSEMENT BY EXCEPTION is used when an instructor has demonstrated adequate knowledge and 
experience but has not met our standard for credentials. An example of such a situation would be the 
instructor who has a bachelor’s/master’s degree in a different teaching field, but has some 
certifications, professional affiliations, and a minimum of five years industry-specific or teaching 
experience.  
 
NOTE ABOUT THE CATALOG 
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs. 
 
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs. 
 The provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded 
as a contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies 
governing admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. 
 
Grace reserves the right to change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without 
prior notice including academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, 
personnel, academic policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any 
courses described in the catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, 
make every attempt to give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog 
content when possible and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
 
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year. 
 
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student.

In some programs, students are asked to acknowledge in writing their receipt of the program’s catalog.  
Changes to an academic catalog that are necessary following the start of the fall semester will be noted 
as an addendum to the original catalog.  
 
Archived catalogs are maintained on the institution’s Web site. 
It is each student’s responsibility to schedule regular meetings with his or her academic advisor and to 
be knowledgeable about institutional requirements, academic regulations, and calendar deadlines 
specified in the catalogs and academic program publications. Students should read the catalog carefully 
and consult with an advisor to determine how these policies relate to their individual circumstances.

Master of Business Administration Program Description 
Program Distinctives 
The Grace College MBA program encourages the study of business from a distinctly biblical perspective.  
We believe that as image bearers of God, we are designed to be both creators and cultivators who serve 
through stewardship of all creation.  Among the first instructions in scripture were for man to subdue 
and have dominion over God’s creation (Genesis 1:26, 28) and to work and keep God’s garden (Genesis 
2:15).  These commands are further developed in other scripture passages and remain in effect to this 
day endowing the practice of business with theological significance. 
The Grace College MBA program was intentionally created to be application oriented. Consistent with 
learning-by-doing, course assignments allow students to use concepts learned in their current 
employment setting. This allows students to quickly develop an initial proficiency with the concepts 
being covered in their class. It also allows students to demonstrate the value-added nature of the 
program. 
These program distinctives are reflected in the program purpose statement and goals that follow.

Note about the Catalog  
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs. 
 
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs. 
 
 The provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded 
as a contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies 
governing admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. 
 
Grace reserves the right to change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without 
prior notice including academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, 
personnel, academic policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any 
courses described in the catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, 
make every attempt to give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog 
content when possible and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
 
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year. 
 
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student. 
 
In some programs, students are asked to acknowledge in writing their receipt of the program’s catalog.  
 
Changes to an academic catalog that are necessary following the start of the fall semester will be noted 
as an addendum to the original catalog.  
 
Archived catalogs are maintained on the institution’s Web site. 
 
It is each student’s responsibility to schedule regular meetings with his or her academic advisor and to 
be knowledgeable about institutional requirements, academic regulations, and calendar deadlines 
specified in the catalogs and academic program publications. Students should read the catalog carefully 
and consult with an advisor to determine how these policies relate to their individual circumstances.

making in the realm of managing the marketing function in an ever-changing environment.  Analysis will

statements and other accounting reports. 
 
This course provides learners with the opportunity to develop and act on an understanding of finance.  
In pursuit of these goals, learner activities focus on four key concepts:  1) the realized return of external 
investors is directly related to the realized outcome of internal management decisions and activities,  2) 
organizations use financial statements to summarize the realized outcomes of management decisions 
and activities and to communicate that information to investors and other external parties, 3) the 
financial accounting model depicts how the individual financial statements fit together and allows 
managers, investors and other interested parties to fully access the information contained in those 
statements, and 4) risk is inherent in economic activity so the expected return from any activity must 
sufficiently compensate for assuming the related risk.  In the course learners also explore how to 
evaluate financial information on organizational activities using insights from Scripture.  Three credit

reality is an uncertain, risky proposition with no guarantee of technical or financial success.  From the 
perspective of Scripture, learners will consider how the entrepreneurial capacity present in humans 
evidences their creation in the image of the ultimate Creator. Three credit hours. 
BUS 5240 Business Policy 
 
This course provides learners with the opportunity to understand organizations from a comparative 
advantage based strategic perspective.  Consistent with that understanding learners develop the 
capacity to formulate and implement strategies that capitalize on and further develop an organization’s 
comparative advantage.  This process of capitalizing on and further developing an organization’s 
comparative advantage will be evaluated using the concept of stewardship found in Scripture.  Three

Community Lifestyle Pledge 
Students agree to show respect for the faith commitment that Grace practices and agree to abide by 
certain of the institution's community guidelines (avoidance of disrespecting others, sexual misconduct, 
illegal drugs, gambling, coarse or obscene language, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and such conduct) 
while on campus or engaged in Grace activities. The student understands that this extends to any 
advocacy initiatives in which the individual might participate while a Grace student. 
 
Computer Usage/Web Site/Blogs/Social Media  
Grace College realizes the value added to technology and relationship building through use of the 
Internet. It is expected that members of the Grace College community maintain appropriate behavior 
while applying scriptural values to any personal Web content created. This includes, but is not limited to, 
blogs, personal and business social media accounts (including, but not limited to: Facebook, Instagram, 
Snapchat, Twitter, TikTok and Tumblr), websites, and/or other creative content. This includes 
“anonymous” content that can reasonably be traced back or attributed to a Grace student. Ultimately, 
Grace students are responsible for what they post or comment online. Therefore, students should not 
post content on social media that violates Grace community lifestyle policies. Posts or comments that 
are harassing or discriminatory to individuals or groups of people, or that reveal community standard 
violations, will result in consequences. Students must comply with copyright laws, file sharing laws, and 
avoid plagiarism. See our “Academic Integrity” policy for more details.

Classification of Graduate Students 
Full-time Students: Full-time students are those enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate program for 
at least 6 semester hours of credit during a regular semester.

       April 2023 
 
Part-time Students: Part-time students are those enrolled in a degree, diploma, or certificate program 
for at least 3 hours of credit during a regular semester. 
 
Auditors:  Students who desire to hear the lectures in a course without undertaking the coursework for 
credit may be admitted as auditors to selected courses by making proper application with the Online 
Admissions Office. Though no credits or grade points are involved, auditors are required to pay the 
appropriate fees and to meet class attendance requirements. Those who do not meet attendance 
requirements will receive the “grade” of “W,” whether or not they have officially withdrawn. 
 
Auditing is not permitted for some courses. (This policy is at the discretion of the department or 
professor involved.) For some courses, auditing is permitted only if the student completes the course 
assignments as specified by the professor. An auditor may enroll for only one semester as a “full-time” 
auditor.  
 
Note about the Catalog  
Each program at the institution maintains a catalog in which basic academic information related to the 
program’s goals, expectations, admission, policies, accreditation, and other pertinent information is 
described. This applies to undergraduate, non-traditional (e.g., online, adult degree completion), 
graduate, and seminary programs. 
 
Grace makes every attempt to provide information that, at the time of publication, most accurately 
describes the policies, procedures, and requirements of the institution and its individual programs. 
 
The provisions of the academic catalogs are, therefore, to be considered a guide and not to be regarded 
as a contract between any student and the institution. Course content and institutional policies 
governing admissions, tuition, and campus life are under constant review and revision. 
 
Grace reserves the right to change any statement contained within the catalog at any time and without 
prior notice including academic provisions, policies, or requirements (e.g., modifications to classes, fees, 
personnel, academic policies, and programs) and the right to withdraw or amend the content of any 
courses described in the catalogs as may be required or desirable by circumstances. Grace will, however, 
make every attempt to give students reasonable prior notice to changes in policies and other catalog 
content when possible and rarely implements policy changes during an academic year.  
 
Courses of study for non-traditional, graduate, and seminary programs and check sheets for 
undergraduate students may undergo revisions; however, these are typically implemented in the fall of 
the new academic year. 
 
All students are expected to be familiar with the catalog(s) associated with their selected program(s) of 
study with the understanding that policies and procedures of their selected program(s) may change 
from year-to-year. The current year’s catalog should, in most situations, be considered the catalog 
applicable to the student. 
 
 In some programs, students are asked to acknowledge in writing their receipt of the program’s catalog.

Changes to an academic catalog that are necessary following the start of the fall semester will be noted 
as an addendum to the original catalog.  
 
Archived catalogs are maintained on the institution’s Web site. 
 
It is each student’s responsibility to schedule regular meetings with his or her academic advisor and to 
be knowledgeable about institutional requirements, academic regulations, and calendar deadlines 
specified in the catalogs and academic program publications. Students should read the catalog carefully 
and consult with an advisor to determine how these policies relate to their individual circumstances.

Program Distinctives 
The Master of Science in Nonprofit Management program will be introduced to valuable concepts, 
practical information and expertise in every class session. Coursework and application projects will help 
students answer, “What will help me do a better job of serving others now?” 
 
Nonprofit management is about developing employees and protecting your clients. Students will 
develop the knowledge and skills to be confident that the organization is doing just that. Instructors will 
emphasize the application of technology for the best results, how to effectively raise funds, how to 
create and train staff, and how to improve efficiency within the organization.  
 
Throughout the MSNM program, the latest technology and techniques on the web, in the world of 
nonprofit organizations, teaching donor management software, and how to use social media effectively 
will be highlighted. In addition, classes in the ethics of fundraising, advocacy, and strategic planning will 
give the student a broad range of knowledge for leading and managing a nonprofit. 
 
The Master of Science in Nonprofit Management degree is offered fully online, allowing students to 
maintain professional responsibilities and keep family commitments while earning their Master’s 
degree. Upon completion of the MSNM degree, students will graduate with the ability to take newly 
acquired knowledge and skills, combined with the innate compassion for something greater than the 
individual, to effectively manage a nonprofit organization.

COURSE DESCRIPTIONS 
NPM 5015 Nonprofit Management as a Career 
People view nonprofits from different perspectives, some considering them to be social institutions and 
others considering them to be more like business firms with a social purpose. This course attempts to 
blend these perspectives and to provide a balanced overview of the field. 
Although some people portray nonprofits as less well-managed than businesses, that perspective is 
often inaccurate. This course will encourage students preparing for careers in nonprofit management to 
proceed with pride and confidence that their field is as distinguished as management in business or 
government.  Together we will thoroughly pursue an understanding of how a nonprofit management 
career brings challenges but also rewards. 
 
NPM 5010 Foundations of Nonprofit Management 
This course will provide an orientation to the nonprofit sector and a theoretical foundation for the more 
applied topics that will be covered later in MSNM Program. Students will begin to develop their personal 
philosophies of management as it applies to the unique environment of the nonprofits. This course 
seeks to engender an overview of nonprofit management that is both conceptual and practical in 
nature.  Three hours. 
NPM 5020 Governing and Leading Nonprofit Organizations 
This course provides learners with the opportunity to learn the many dynamics involved in leading an 
organization under the auspices of a governing board. Best practice strategies and activities will be 
utilized regarding effective and ethical leadership, managing an organization, and recruiting, developing, 
evaluating and retaining human capital within the organization.  Three hours. 
NPM 5030 Obtaining and Managing Resources for Nonprofit Organizations 
Introduces students to the major financial management concepts and techniques required for effective 
management of nonprofit organizations. Offers students an opportunity to learn about nonprofit 
accounting, budget management, cash flow management, financial statements and reports. 
 
NPM 5040 Managing the Nonprofit Organization 
Nonprofit organizations can thrive only when there is a clear understanding of the internal and external 
realities that impact a company’s present status and potential for growth. This course will examine 
various ways to ensure accountability to external stakeholders and effectively measure performance. 
The strategic planning process will also be examined in depth, and students will learn how to utilize 
planning skills in a practical exercise with a company of their choice. Students will also examine ways to 
help nonprofit companies build capacity and explore opportunities for collaboration.  Three hours. 
NPM 5050 Marketing, Communication and Special Topics for Nonprofit Organizations 
This course is a guide through four topics that can easily be confusing or too new for nonprofit leaders 
to handle without help. 1) Leaders, must know the values and pitfalls of marketing so that the mission 
remains the primary focus. 2) Advocacy includes education of the public in addition to the challenging 
topic of lobbying that few nonprofits engage in with confidence. 3) Globalization affects many local 
nonprofits as there may be chapters abroad. Leaders must be aware of the management and board 
'best practices' that come from globalized nonprofits. 4) Social entrepreneurship is a newer topic that 
covers innovation to provide new income streams for a target population, social impact or both. 
Business for missions, community development, and micro finance are related topics.  Three hours.
