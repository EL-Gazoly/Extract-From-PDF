ENGL 4460,Literature & Theology of Grief,3,"Grief presents both a theological and a practical problem. 
Theologically, grief seems to challenge the core of the Christian claim that Christ has overcome the conditions that 
produce grief, such as death, corruption, failure, shame, and loss. Grief would not seem to have a place within the 
church, because to grieve—to mourn a loss—challenges the truth of the gospel that Christians proclaim. At the same 
time, however, Christians and all humans continue to inhabit a world in which grief remains a universal experience, 
one that presents not only an intellectual problem but an existential one: how can we cope with something that is at 
once so common and so crippling? This course takes up these questions and proceeds from two closely related 
propositions: (1) that theology provides categories and practices for addressing the problem of grief, and (2) that 
literature offers us a framework for engaging the intersection between the problem of grief and the human, lived 
experience of it. Accordingly, we will use a critical reading of important literary, theoretical and theological texts to 
begin the process of reflecting on the problems of grief and loss and to begin the process of imagining what response 
to grief might look like. We will frame this discussion throughout as an explicitly theological attempt to construct a 
vision of Christian faith and practice that emphasizes the priority of healing and wholeness. Prerequisites: English 
Composition I and II with a grade of C or higher. "

HUMN 3500,Literature and Theology of Race,3,"Martin Luther King gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech 
more than 50 years ago, but the problem of racial relationships remains as troubling and divisive today as it was 
then. Deep-seated mistrust and antagonism between races continues to pervade our social landscape. This course 
proceeds from three closely related propositions: (1) that racial division contradicts the Gospel, (2) that theology 
provides categories and practices for addressing the problem of racial division, and (3) that literature offers us a 
framework for engaging the intersection between racial division and the theological application of reconciliation. 
Accordingly, we will use a critical reading of important literary, theoretical and theological texts to begin the 
process of reflecting on the problems of racial division and to begin the process of imagining what racial 
reconciliation might look like. We will frame this discussion throughout as an explicitly theological attempt to 
construct a vision of Christian faith and practice that emphasizes the priority of racial reconciliation. Prerequisites:
